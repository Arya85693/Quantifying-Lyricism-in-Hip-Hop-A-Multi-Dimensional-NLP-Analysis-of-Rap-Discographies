me\nPromise that you will sing about me\nI said when the lights shut off and it's my turn\nTo settle down, my main concern\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\n\nI woke up this mornin' and figured I'd call you\nIn case I'm not here tomorrow\nI'm hopin' that I can borrow\nA peace of mind, I'm behind on what's really important\nMy mind is really distorted\nI find nothin' but trouble in my life\nI'm fortunate you believe in a dream\nThis orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine\nAnd last night was just another distraction\nOr a reaction of what we consider madness\nI know exactly what happened\nYou ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help\nHeld him like a newborn baby and made him feel\nLike everything was alright in a fight he tried to put up\nBut the type of bullet that stuck\nHad went against his will, that's blood spilled on your hands\nMy plan's rather vindictive\nEverybody's a victim in my eyes\nWhen I ride it's a murderous rhythm\nAnd outside became pitch black\nA demon glued to my back, whispering \"Get 'em!\"\nI got 'em and I ain't give a fuck\nThat same mentality I told my brother not to duck\nIn actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors\nI wonder if I'll ever discover a passion like you and recover\nThe life that I knew as a youngin\nIn pajamas and dun-ta-duns\nWhen thunder comes it rains cats and dogs dumb\nNiggas like me never prosper\nPrognosis of a problem child, I'm proud and well-devoted\nThis Piru shit been in me forever\nSo forever I'ma push it, wherever, whenever\nAnd I love you 'cause you love my brother like you did\nJust promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big\nAnd if I die before your album drop, I hope— [\nGunshots\n]\n\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\nI said when the lights shut off and it's my turn\nTo settle down, my main concern\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\n\nYou wrote a song about my sister on your tape\nAnd called it \nSection.80\nThe message resembled \"Brenda's Got a Baby\"\nWhat's crazy was I was hearin' about it\nBut doubted your ignorance\nHow could you ever just put her on blast and shit?\nJudgin' her past and shit?\nWell, it's completely my future\nHer nigga behind me right now askin' for ass and shit\nAnd I'ma need that forty dollars\nEven if I gotta fuck, suck and swallow\nIn the parking lot, Gonzales Park, I'm followed\nBy a married man, and father of three\nMy titties bounce on the cadence of his tinklin' keys\nMatter of fact, he my favorite 'cause he tip me with E's\nHe got a cousin named David and I seen him last week\nThis is the life of another girl damaged by the system\nThese foster homes, I run away and never do miss 'em\nSee, my hormones just run away and if I can get 'em\nBack to where they used to be, then I'll probably be in the denim\nOf a family gene that show women how to be woman\nOr better yet, a leader, you need her to learn somethin'\nThen you probably need to beat her, that's how I was taught\nThree niggas in one room, first time I was tossed\nAnd I'm exhausted, but fuck that \"Sorry for your loss\" shit\nMy sister died in vain, but what point are you tryna gain\nIf you can't fit the pumps I walk in?\nI'll wait… Your rebuttal a little too late\nAnd if you have a album date, just make sure I'm not in the song\n'Cause I don't need the attention, bring enough of that on my own\nAnd matter fact, did I mention that I physically feel great?\nA doctor's approval is a waste of time, I know I'm straight\nI'll probably live longer than you and never fade away\nI'll never fade away, I'll never fade away, I know my fate\nAnd I'm on the grind for this cake, I'ma get it or die tryin'\nI'm eyein' every male gender with intentions of buyin'\nYou lyin' to these motherfuckers\nTalkin' about you can help 'em with my story\nYou can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga\nDon't ignore me, nigga, fuck your glory, nigga, bullshit\nAnd when I die, make sure my pussy tight...\n\nWhen the lights shut off and it's my turn\nTo settle down, my main concern\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\nI said when the lights shut off and it's my turn\nTo settle down, my main concern\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\n\nSometimes I look in the mirror\nAnd ask myself am I really scared of passin' away?\nIf it's today, I hope I hear a\nCry out from Heaven so loud it can water down a demon\nWith the Holy Ghost 'til it drown in the blood of Jesus\nI wrote some raps that made sure that my lifeline reekin'\nThe scent of a reaper, ensurin' that my allegiance\nWith the other side may come soon, and if I'm doomed\nMay the womb of my mother be blessed for many moons\nI suffer a lot\nAnd every day that glass mirror get tougher to watch\nI tie my stomach in knots\nAnd I'm not sure why I'm infatuated with death\nMy imagination is surely an aggravation of threats\nThat can come about, 'cause the tongue is mighty powerful\nAnd I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch\nMaybe 'cause I'm a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death\nReally stuck in the schema of wonderin' when I'ma rest\nAnd you're right, your brother was a brother to me\nAnd your sister's situation was the one that pulled me\nIn a direction to speak on somethin' that's realer than the TV screen\nBy any means, wasn't tryin' to offend or come between\nHer personal life, I was like \"It need to be told\"\nCursin' the life of twenty generations after her soul\nExactly what'd happen if I ain't continue rappin'\nOr steady bein' distracted by money, drugs, and 4-5's\nI count lives, all on these songs\nLook at the weak and cry, pray one day you'll be strong\nFightin' for your rights, even when you're wrong\nAnd hope that at least one of you sing about me when I'm gone\nAm I worth it? Did I put enough work in?\n\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\nI said when the lights shut off and it's my turn\nTo settle down, my main concern\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\n\nPromise that you'll sing about me forever\nPromise that you'll sing about me for— ooh\nPromise that you'll sing about me forever\nPromise that you'll sing about me for— ooh\nPromise that you'll sing about me forever\nPromise that you'll sing about me for— ooh\nPromise that you'll sing about me forever\nPromise that you'll sing about me for— ooh\n\n\n(On the phone)\n\"Ay, ay, ay, where you 'bout to go?\"\n\"Nigga, the homie's brother—nigga, right here, he gone, my nigga, he gone!\"\n\"Hey, come to the store for a nigga, one time.\"\n\"We on the block right now, my nigga, like, we—nigga, we right here, my nigga.\"\n\"Bring a nigga back a black!\"\n\"Nigga—bruh—nigga, they just killed the homie's brother, my nigga.

Wings begin to emerge, breakin' the cycle of feelin' stagnant\nFinally free, the butterfly sheds light on situations that the caterpillar never considered\nEndin' the internal struggle\nAlthough the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different\nThey are one and the same\"\nWhat's your perspective on that?\n'Pac?

reflejan tu mirada\nLa noche, tú y yo\n\nI got this fire burnin' in me from within\nConcentrated thoughts on who I used to be, I'm sheddin' skin\nEvery day, a new version of me, a third of me demented, cemented in pain\nJuggling the pros and cons of fame\nI don't know how to make friends, I'm a lonely soul\nI recollect this isolation, I was four years old\nTruth be told, I've been battling myself\nTryna navigate the real and fake\nCynical about the judgement day\nI did past life regression last year and it fucked me up\nReincarnated on this earth for a hundred plus\nBody after body, lesson after lesson, let's take it back to Michigan in 1947\nMy father kicked me out the house 'cause I wouldn't listen to him\nI didn't care about his influence, only loved what I was doing\nGifted as a musician, I played guitar on a grand level\nThe most talented where I'm from, but I had to rebel\nAnd so I'm off in the sunset, searchin' for my place in the world\nWith my guitar up on my hip as the story unfurled\nI found myself with a pocket full of money and a whole lot of respect\nWhile the record business loved me\nI was head of rhythm and blues\nThe women that fell to they feet, so many to choose\nBut I manipulated power as I lied to the masses\nDied with my money, gluttony was too attractive, reincarnated\n\nAnother life had placed me as a Black woman in the Chitlin' Circuit\nSeductive vocalist as the promoter hit the curtains\nMy voice was angelic, straight from heaven, the crowd sobbed\nA musical genius what the articles emphasized\nHad everything I wanted, but I couldn't escape addiction\nHeroin needles had me in fetal position, restricted\nTurned on my family, I went wherever cameras be\nCocaine, no private planes for my insanity\nSelf-indulged, discipline never been my sentiments\nI needed drugs, to me, an 8-ball was like penicillin\nFuck love, my happiness was in that brown sugar\nSex and melodies gave me hope when nobody's lookin'\nMy first assistant was a small town scholar\nNever did a Quaalude 'til I got myself around her\nMy daddy looked the other way, he saw sin in me\nI died with syringes pinched in me, reincarnated\n\nMy present life is Kendrick Lamar\nA rapper looking at the lyrics to keep you in awe\nThe only factor I respected was raisin' the bar\nMy instincts sent material straight to the charts, huh\nMy father kicked me out the house, I finally forgive him\nI'm old enough to understand the way I was livin'\nEgo and pride had me looking at him with resentment\nI close my eyes, hoping that I don't come off contentious\nI'm yelling, \"Father, did I finally get it right?\" Everything I did was selfless\nI spoke freely, when the people needed me, I helped them\nI didn't gloat, even told 'em, \"No,\" when the vultures came\nTook control of my fleshly body when the money changed\nSon, you do well, but your heart is closed\nI can tell residue that linger from your past creates itself\nFather, I'm not perfect, I got urges, but I hold them down\n\"But your pride has to die,\" okay, Father, show me how\nTell me every deed that you done and what you do it for\nI kept one hundred institutions paid\nOkay, tell me more\nI put one hundred hoods on one stage\nOkay, tell me more\nI'm tryna push peace in L.A. \nBut you love war\nNo, I don't\nOh, yes, you do\nOkay, then tell me the truth\nEvery individual is only a version of you\nHow can they forgive when there's no forgiveness in your heart?\nI could tell you where I'm going\nI could tell you who you are\nYou fell out of Heaven 'cause you was anxious\nDidn't like authority, only searched to be heinous\nIsaiah fourteen was the only thing that was prevalent\nMy greatest music director was you\nIt was colors, it was pinks, it was reds, it was blues\nIt was harmony and motion\nI sent you down to earth 'cause you was broken\nRehabilitation, not psychosis\nBut now we here now\nCenturies you manipulated man with music\nEmbodied you as superstars to see how you moving\nYou came a long way from garnishing evilish views\nAnd all I ever wanted from you was love and approval\nI learned a lot, no more putting these people in fear\nThe more that word is diminished, the more it's not real\nThe more light that I can capture, the more I can feel\nI'm using words for inspiration as an idea\nSo can you promise that you won't take your gifts for granted?\nI promise that I'll use my gifts to bring understanding\nFor every man, woman and child, how much can you vow?\nI vow my life just to live one in harmony now\nYou crushed a lot of people

Margielas'll chip you for designer\nBelt buckles and clout, overzealous if prone to violence\nMake the wrong turn, be it will or the wheel alignment\nResidue burned, mist of the inner-city\nMiscommunication to keep homi' detective busy\nNo protection is risky\nDesensitized, I vandalized pain, covered up and camouflaged\nGet used to hearin' arsenal rain\nAnalyze, risk your life, take the charge\nHomies done fucked your baby mama once you hit the yard\nThat's culture\nTwenty-three hour lockdown, then somebody called\nSaid your lil' nephew was shot down, the culture's involved\nI done seen niggas do seventeen, hit the halfway house\nGet out and get his brains blown out, lookin' to buy some weed\nCar wash is played out, new GoFundMe accounts'll proceed\nA brand-new

protection, they gon' hold ya\nThe streets got me fucked up, y'all can miss me\nI wanna represent for us\nNew revolution was up and movin'\nI'm in Argentina wiping my tears, full of confusion\nWater in between us, another peer's been executed\nHistory repeats again\nMake amends, then find a nigga with the same skin to do it\nBut that's the culture, crack a bottle\nHard to deal with the pain when you're sober\nBy tomorrow, we forget the remains, we start over\nThat's the problem\nOur foundation was trained to accept whatever follows\nDehumanized, insensitive\nScrutinize the way we live for you and I\nEnemies shook my hand, I can promise I'll meet you\nIn the land where no equal is your equal\nNever say I ain't told ya, nah\nIn the land where hurt people hurt more people\nFuck callin' it

persevered\nConsciousness is synchronized and crystal-clear\nEuphoria is glorified and made His\nReflectin' on my life and what I done\nPaid dues, made rules, change outta love\nThem same views made schools change curriculums\nBut didn't change me starin' down the barrel of the gun\nShould I feel resentful I didn't see my full potential?\nShould I feel regret about the good that I was into?\nEverything is everything, this ain't coincidental\nI woke up that morning with more heart to give you\nAs I bleed through the speakers, feel my presence\nTo my brother, to my kids, I'm in Heaven\nTo my mother, to my sis, I'm in Heaven\nTo my father, to my wife, I am serious, this is Heaven\nTo my friends, make sure you countin' them blessings\nTo my fans, make sure you make them investments\nAnd to the killer that sped up my demise\nI forgive you, just know your soul's in question\nI seen the pain in your pupil when that trigger had squeezed\nAnd though you did me gruesome, I was surely relieved\nI completed my mission, wasn't ready to leave\nBut fulfilled my days, my Creator was pleased\nI can't stress how I love y'all\nI don't need to be in flesh just to hug y'all\nThe

what I wanna do\nI say what I wanna say, when I feel, and I\nLook in the mirror and know I'm there\nWith my hands in the air, I'm proud to say yeah\nI'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real\nI'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real\nI'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real\nI'm real, I'm real ('Cause before you know it, everything's gone)\n\nThe reason why I know you very well\n'Cause we have the same eyes, can't you tell?\nThe days I tried to cover up and conceal\nMy pride, it only made it harder for me to deal\nWhen living in a world that come with plan B\nA scapegoat 'cause plan A don't come free\nAnd plan C just an excuse like \"because\"\nOr the word \"but,\" but what if I got love?\nI love them, I love when I love her\nI love so much, I love when love hurts\nI love first verse 'cause you're the girl I attract\nI love second verse 'cause you're the homie that pack\nBurner like a stove top, that love cooking from scratch\nI love what the both of you have to offer\nIn fact, I love it so much, I don't love anything else\nBut what love got to do with it when I don't love myself\nTo the point I should hate everything I do love\nShould I hate living my life inside the club?\nShould I hate her for watching me for that reason?\nShould I hate him for telling me that I'm seizin'?\nShould I hate them for telling me \"ball out\"?\nShould I hate street credibility I'm talkin' about\nHating all money, power, respect in my will\nOr hating the fact none of that shit make me real?\n\nKenny, I ain't trippin' off them dominoes anymore\nJust calling, sorry to hear what happened to your homeboy\nBut don't learn the hard way like I did, homie\nAny nigga can kill a man, that don't make you a real nigga\nReal is responsibility\nReal is taking care of your motherfucking family\nReal is God, nigga\n\nI do what I wanna do\nI say what I wanna say, when I feel, and I\nLook in the mirror and know I'm there\nWith my hands in the air, I'm proud to say yeah\nI'm real, I'm

because right about now that's what y'all need\nOh, and Top Dawg called the house too\nI guess they want you and Dave to come to the studio\nBut look, you take that music business serious, and put out somethin' me and your dad can step to\nShit, you know we from Chicago, you know that's what we do\n\nSing my song, it's all for you\nSing my song, it's all for you\nSing my song, it's all for

Compton\nLet 'em know you was just like them\nBut you still rose from that dark place of violence, becoming a positive person\nBut when you do make it, give back with your words of encouragement\nAnd that's the best way to give back to your city\nAnd I love you Kendrick\nIf I don't hear you knocking on the door, you know where I usually leave the key, alright?\nTalk to you later, bye\n(*Sound of a

out\nThis is how we conceptualize human beings\n\nMy auntie is a man now\nI think I'm old enough to understand now\nDrinking Paul Masson with her hat turned backwards\nMotorola pager, off-white Guess jacket\nBlue Air Max's, gold chains, and curl kits\n'93 Nissan wax job, the earliest\nBig social, big personality, vocal\nPlayed the underground verbatim and stayed local\nMy auntie is a man now\nI watch him and his girl hold their hands down\nTip of the avenues under street lights made his\nThinking, \"I want me a bad bitch when I get big\"\nThey hug on the corner like California King\nCold hand all up her skirt, cars whistling down the road\nSee, my auntie is a man now, slight bravado\nScratching the likes from lotto\nHoping that she pull up tomorrow\nSo I can hang out in the front seat\nSix-by-nines keeping the music up under me\nMy auntie is a man now\nAsked my mama why my uncles don't like him that much\nAnd at the parties why they always wanna fight him that much\nShe said, \"Ain't no tellin'\nNiggas always been jealous because he had more women\nMore money and more attention made more envy\nCalling him anything but broke was less offending\"\n\nMy auntie is a man now\nI think I'm old enough to understand now\nDrinking Paul Masson with her hat turned backwards\nBack when it was comedic relief to say, \"Faggot\"\n\"Faggot, faggot, faggot,\" we ain't know no better\nElementary kids with no filter, however\nMy auntie became a man and I took pride in it\nShe wasn't gay, she ate pussy, and that was the difference\nThat's what I told my friends in second grade\nShe picking me up from school, they stare at her in the face\nThey couldn't comprehend what I grew accustomed\nWe pull off bumpin' Quik like it was nothing\nMy auntie is a man now, what a relationship\nI grew up fast, I needed no one to babysit\nHe gave me some cash then gave me some game\nCherry freshener on the dash, I never complained\nShe even cut my hair at the pad, was loving my fade\nThe first person I seen write a rap\nThat's when my life had changed\nHouse full of demo, smoke stuck on the window\nCameras on the microphone, all women and men know\nMy auntie was a man now, we cool with it\nThe history had trickled down and made us ign'ant\nMy favorite cousin said he's returning the favor\nAnd following my auntie with the same behavior\n\nDemetrius is Mary-Ann now\nHe's more confident to live his plan now (Talking to the world's gonna bring you down)\nBut the family in disbelief this time (Talking to the world's gonna bring you down)\nConvincing themselves, \"He ain't living discreet, he's fine\" (Talking to the world's gonna bring you down)\nThey said they never seen it in him, but I seen it (\nOoh, ooh, ooh, ooh\n)\nThe Barbie dolls played off reflection of Venus (\nOoh, ooh, ooh, ooh\n)\nHe built a wall so tall you couldn't climb over\nHe didn't laugh as hard when the kids start joking (\nOoh, ooh, ooh, ooh\n)\n\"Faggot, faggot, faggot,\" we ain't know no better\nMiddle school kids with no filter, however\nI had to be very mindful of my good cousin\nI knew exactly who he was, but I still loved him\nDemetrius is Mary-Ann now\nI mean he's really Mary-Ann, even took things further\nChanged his gender before Bruce Jenner was certain\nLiving his truth even if it meant see a surgeon\nWe didn't talk for a while, he seemed more distant\nWasn't comfortable around me, everything was offensive\nBut I recall we both had a sick sense of humor\nMade raw, but time changes all\n\nDemetrius is Mary-Ann now\nRemember church, Easter Sunday?\nI sat in the pew, you had stronger faith\nMore spiritual when these dudes were living life straight\nWhich I found ironic 'cause the pastor didn't see him the same\nHe said my cousin was going through some things\nHe promised the world we living in was an act on abomination\nAnd Demetrius was to blame\nI knew you was conflicted by the feelings of preacherman\nWondering if God still call you a decent man\nStill, you found the courage to be subservient just to anoint\nUntil he singled you out to prove his point, saying\n\"Demetrius is Mary-Ann now\nChurch, his auntie is a man now,\" it hurt\nYou the most 'cause your belief was close to his words\nForcing me to stand now\nI said, \"Mr. Preacherman, should we love thy neighbor?\nThe laws of the land or the heart, what's greater?\nI recognize the study she was taught since birth\nBut that don't justify the feelings that my cousin preserved\"\nThe building was thinking out loud, bad angel\nThat's when you looked at me and smiled, said, \"Thank you\"\nThe day I chose humanity over religion\nThe family got closer, it was all forgiven\nI said them F-bombs, I ain't know any better\nMistakenly, I ain't think that you'd know any different\nSee, I was taught words was nothing more than a sound\nIf ever they was pronounced without any intentions\nThe very second you challenged the shit I was kicking\nReminded me about a show I did out the city\nThat time I brung a fan on stage to rap\nBut disapproved the word that she couldn't say with me\nYou said, \"Kendrick, ain't no room for contradiction\nTo truly understand love, switch position\n'Faggot, faggot, faggot,' we can say it together\nBut only if you let a white girl say 'Nigga'\"", "retrieval_timestamp": "2026-01-14T15:04:14.889256", "data_source": "genius_api"}

live in fear\nAnd I'll be that raising voice and tell the people treat us fair\nWarring in the streets tell them soldiers to meet us there\nOut in the open all alone, I felt the coldest air\nSecluded

thugging, they clapping at me, a encore\nGot a dark heart, bright mind, make women crazy\nI give her D, I throw up two, I call that shit a safety\nShit is crazy when entertainment ain't entertaining\nAnd my inner sanctum need real estate I'm out my cabeza\nJealousy's for the weak, you ain't happy I made it\nI be feeling like brother Malcolm just out of the Nation\nAllah got us cause if we hollered a lost numbers\nI seen hustlers turn cluckers out niggas grandmothers\nSo shut the fuck up and listen, fuck all them stuck up musicians\nMy circle small but regardless, my circumference official\nMy clothes different like quarterbacks at a closed scrimmage\nThey gon' blitz us but ain't no way that they gon' hit us\nI'm so elusive, so my niggas be goin' through it\nGuess it's a wrap when your co-defendant make soul music\nCash rule the world -- at least it do with girls\nAt least it do with churches, seek the truth and true it hurts\nIf they real, then they real -- my niggas deserve it\nAnd we don't deal with weak squares in this power circle\nWe don't deal with weak squares in this power circle\n\nI'm like welcome to the power circle\nI came a long way, I started with a powdered circle\nClique full of real niggas that'll probably murk you\nCause they about that murder game you do a lot of verbal\nLotta talking, lotta Tweeting, 'til you hear that chopper speaking\nKill my dog, I kill your dog, we tied even, I'd believe it\nIf you see it then you got it, nigga never give up\nCause if you grindin' you gon' be rich before you can look up\nMy cousin Knock told me never teach niggas to cook up\nCause you can sell 'em hard for the low and give 'em the hookup\nAnd still make the profit\nThe streets say I'm the hottest and a nigga still modest\nI'm just being honest\nBack to the wall, never let 'em get behind us\nMac in my draws fitting right in my designers\nLook at my persona, I dreamed it, woke up and conquered\nAnd there was commas after commas, I eat 'em like Benihanas\nPut the shrimp over the pasta, the pasta over the lobster\nAnd the lobster over the table, power circle a mafia\nJust talkin' money, talkin' money what you talkin'

compromise\nAnd so I walk alone with a cross and a diamond stone\nI'm a diamond inside the rough that's too mighty for maricons\nI might as well put all my killers in YSL\nPut my voice on this

upstate will adjourn that life and confirm that life\nIt's good bait for the warden that might get awarded and write\nNow your fate can record it denied a reporter replied\nThe death rate will eventually climb, so eventually I'm\nOn a track race for the dough before time get a clock that resigns\nSo about face if it ain't business, I get offended, I mind\nNow one fake, I'm a realist in

Into the parking lot of a local hamburger stand pulls a chromed-out black Mercedes SUV, driven by 27-year-old Kendrick Lamar, arguably the most talented rapper of his generation. there are a half-dozen guys from the neighborhood waiting to meet him: L, Turtle, G-Weed. \"I grew up with all these cats,\" Lamar says. He nods to Mingo, a Compton-born sweetheart who is roughly the size of the truck he arrived in: \"I don't need to hire a bodyguard. Look how fucking big he is!\" The burger joint, Tam's, sits at the corner of Rosecrans and Central, a famous local spot recently made infamous when Suge Knight allegedly ran over two men with his truck in the parking lot, killing one of them. \"Homey died right here,\" G-Weed says, pointing to a dark spot on the asphalt. \"That security camera caught everything. They're building a case.\"\nLamar grew up just six blocks from here, in a little blue three-bedroom house at 1612 137th St. Across the street is the Louisiana Fried Chicken where he used to get the three-piece meal with fries and lemonade; over there is the Rite Aid where he walked to buy milk for his little brothers. Tam's was another hangout. \"This is where I seen my second murder, actually.\" he says. \"Eight years old, walking home from McNair Elementary. Dude was in the drive-thru ordering his food, and homey ran up, boom boom - smoked him.\" He saw his first murder at age five, a teenage drug dealer gunned down outside Lamar's apartment building. \"After that,\" he says, \"you just get numb to it.\"\nIt's almost noon, but Lamar is just starting his day - having spent a late night in the studio scrambling to finish his new album, To Pimp a Butterfly, which has to be done in five days. He's dressed casually in a gray hoodie, maroon sweatpants, and white socks with black slides, but recognizable enough that an old lady in line decides to tease him while complaining about the heat inside. \"Y'all need to put the air conditioner on,\" she calls to the manager. \"Kendrick Lamar is here!\"\nLamar may be a two-time Grammy winner with a platinum debut executive-produced by Dr. Dre, and with fans from Kanye West to Taylor Swift. But here at Tam's, he's also Kendrick Duckworth, Paula and Kenny's son. Inside, a middle-aged woman who just left church comes up and gives him a hug, and he buys lunch for a cart-toting lady he knows used to be a harmless crack addict. (\"She used to chase us with sticks and stuff, he says.) Outside, an old man in a motorized wheelchair scoots over to introduce himself. He says he moved here in 1951, when Compton was still majority-white. \"Back in the day, we had the baddest cars in L.A.,\" he says. \"I just wanted you to know where you came from. It's a hell of a neighborhood.\"\nOn his breakthrough album, 2012's good kid, m.A.A.d City, Lamar made his name by chronicling this neighborhood, vividly evoking a specific place (this same stretch of Rosecrans) and a specific time (in the summer of 2004, between 10th and 11th grade). It was a concept album about adolescence, told with cinematic precision through the eyes of someone young enough to recall every detail (as in: \"Me and my niggas four deep in a white Toyota/A quarter tank of gas, one pistol, one orange soda\")\nLamar's parents moved here from Chicago in 1984, three years before Kendrick was born. His dad, Kenny Duckworth, was reportedly running with a South Side street gang called the Gangster Disciples, so his mom, Paula Oliver, issued an ultimatum. \"She said, 'I can't fuck with you if you ain't trying to better yourself,'\" Lamar recounts. \"'We can't be in the streets forever.'\" They stuffed their clothes in two black garbage bags and boarded a train to California with $500. \"They were going to go to San Bernardino,\" Lamar says. \"But my Auntie Tina was in Compton. She got 'em a hotel until they got on their feet, and my mom got a job at McDonald's.\" For the first couple of years, they slept in their car or motels, or in the park when it was hot enough. \"Eventually, they saved enough money to get their first apartment, and that's when they had me.\"\nLamar has a lot of good memories of Compton as a kid: riding bikes, doing back flips off friends' roofs, sneaking into the living room during his parents' house parties. (\"I'd catch him in the middle of the dance floor with his shirt off,\" his mom says. \"Like, 'What the...? Get back in that room!'\") Then there's one of his earliest memories - the afternoon of April 29th, 1992, the first day of the South Central riots\nKendrick was four. \"I remember riding with my pops down Bullis Road, and looking out the window and seeing motherfuckers just running,\" he says. \"I can see smoke. We stop, and my pops goes into the AutoZone and comes out rolling four tires. I know he didn't buy them. I'm like, 'What's going on?'\" (Says Kenny, \"We were all taking stuff. That's the way it was in the riots!\")\n\"Then we get to the house,\" Lamar continues, \"and him and my uncles are like, 'We fixing to get this, we fixing to get that, we fixing to get all this shit!' I'm thinking they're robbing. There's some real mayhem going on in L.A. Then, as time progresses, I'm watching the news, hearing about Rodney King and all this, I said to my mom, 'So the police beat up a black man, and now everybody's mad? Ok. I get it now.'\"\nWe've been sitting on the patio a while when Lamar sees someone he knows at the bus stop. \"Matt Jeezy! What up, bro?\" Matt Jeezy nods. \"That's my boy,\" Lamar says. \"He's part of the inner circle.\" Lamar has a few friends like this, guys he's known all his life. But often he'd rather be by himself\n\"He was always a loner,\" Kendrick's mom says. Lamar agrees: \"I was always in the corner of the room watching.\" He has two little brothers and one younger sister, but until he was seven, he was an only child. He was so precocious his parents nicknamed him Man-Man. \"I grew up fast as fuck,\" he says. \"My moms used to walk me home from school - we didn't have no car - and we'd talk from the county building to the welfare office.\" \"He would ask me questions about Section 8 and the Housing Authority, so I'd explain it to him,\" his mom says. \"I was keeping it real.\"\nThe Duckworths survived on welfare and food stamps, and Paula did hair for $20 a head. His dad had a job at KFC, but at a certain point, says Lamar, \"I realized his work schedule wasn't really adding up.\" It wasn't until later that he suspected Kenny was probably making money off the streets. \"They wanted to keep me innocent,\" Lamar says now. \"I love them for that.\" To this day, he and his dad have never discussed it. \"I don't know what type of demons he has,\" Lamar says, \"but I don't wanna bring them shits up.\" (Says Kenny, \"I don't want to talk about that bad time. But I did what I had to do.\")\nThere's a famous story from Tom Petty's childhood in which a 10-year-old Tom sees Elvis shooting a movie near his hometown in Florida, takes on look at the white Cadillac and the girls, and decides to become a rock star on the spot. Lamar has a similar story - only for him it's sitting on his dad's shoulders outside the Compton Swap Meet, age eight, watching Dr. Dre and 2Pac shoot a video for \"California Love.\" \"I want to say they were in a white Bentley,\" Lamar says. (It was actually black.) \"These motorcycle cops trying to conduct traffic but one almost scraped the car, and Pac stood up on the passenger seat, like, 'Yo, what the fuck!'\" He laughs. \"Yelling at the police, just like on his motherfucking songs. He gave us what we wanted.\"\nBeing a rapper was far from preordained for Lamar. As late as middle school, he had a noticeable stutter. \"Just certain words,\" he says. \"It came when I was excited or in trouble.\" He loved basketball - he was short, but quick - and dreamed of making it to the NBA. But in seventh grade, an English teacher named Mr. Inge turned him on to poetry - rhymes, metaphors, double-entendres - and Lamar fell in love. \"You could put all your feelings down on a sheet of paper, and they'd make sense to you,\" he says. \"I liked that.\"\nAt home, Lamar started writing non-stop. \"We used to wonder what he was doing with all that paper,\" his dad says. \"I thought he was doing homework! I didn't know he was writing lyrics.\" \"I had never heard him say profanity before,\" says his mom. \"Then I found his little rap lyrics, and it was all 'Eff you.' 'D-i-c-k.' I'm like, 'Oh, my God! Kendrick's a cusser!'\"\nAn A student, Lamar flirted with the idea of going to college. \"I could have went. I should have went.\" (He still might: \"It's always in the back of my mind. It's not too late.\") But by the time he was in high school, he was running with a bad crowd. This is the crew he raps about on good kid, m.A.A.d City - the ones doing robberies, home invasions, running from the cops\nOnce his mom found a bloody hospital gown, from a trip he took to the ER with \"one of his little homeys who got smoked.\" Another time she found him curled up crying in the front yard. She thought he was sad because his grandmother had just died: \"I didn't know somebody had shot at him.\" One night, the police knocked on their door and said he was involved in an incident in their neighborhood, and his parents, in a bout of tough love, kicked him out for two days. \"And that's a scary thing,\" Lamar says, \"because you might not come back.\"\nAfter a couple of hours, the mood on Rosecrans starts to shift. An ambulance roars by, sirens blaring. In the middle of the street, a homeless man is shouting at passing cars. Lamar starts to grow uneasy, his eyes glancing at the corners. I ask if everything's OK. \"It's the temperature,\" he says. \"It's uh, raising a little bit.\" A few minutes later, one of his friends - who's been cruising back and forth on his bicycle all afternoon, \"patrolling the perimeter\" - calls out, \"Rollers!\" and a few seconds later, two L.A. County sherrif cruisers round the corner. \"There they go,\" Lamar says, as they hit their lights and take off\nAs a teenager, \"the majority of my interactions with police were not good,\" Lamar says. \"There were a few good ones who were actually protecting the community. But then you have ones from the Valley. They never met me in their life, but since I'm a kid in basketball shorts and a white T-shirt, they wanna slam me on the hood of the car. Sixteen years old,\" he says, nodding toward the street. \"Right there by that bus stop. Even if he's not a good kid, that don't give you the right to slam a minor on the ground, or pull a pistol on him.\"\nLamar says he's had police pull guns on him on two occasions. The first was when he was 17, cruising around Compton with his friend Moose. He says a cop spotted their flashy green Camaro and pulled them over, and when Moose couldn't find his license fast enough, the cop pulled a gun. \"He literally put the beam on my boy's head,\" Lamar recalls. \"I remember driving off in a silence, feeling violated, and him being so angry a tear dropped from his eye.\" The story of the second time is murkier: Lamar won't say what he and his friends were up to, only that a cop drew his gun and they ran. \"We was in the wrong,\" he admits. \"But we just kids. It's not worth pulling your gun out over. Especially when we running away.\"\nFriends of his weren't so lucky. Just after midnight on June 13th, 2007, officers from the LAPD's Southeast Division responded to a domestic-violence call on East 120th Street, about five minutes from Lamar's house. There, they found his good friend D.T. allegedly holding a 10-inch knife. According to police, D.T. charged, and an officer opened fire, killing him. \"It never really quite added up,\" Lamar says. \"But here's the crazy thing. Normally when we find out somebody got killed, the first thing we say is 'Who did it? Where we gotta go?' It's a gang altercation. But this time it was the police - the biggest gang in California. You'll never win against them.\"\nOn an otherwise positive song called \"Hiiipower,\" from his 2011 mixtape Section.80, Lamar rapped, \"I got my finger on the motherfucking pistol/Aim it at a pig, Charlotte's Web is going to miss you.\" It's an unsettling line, especially coming from a rapper who often subverts gangster tropes but rarely trafficks in them. \"I was angry,\" he says. \"To be someone with a good heart, and to still be harassed as a kid...it took a toll on me. Soon you're just saying, 'Fuck everything.' That line was me getting those frustrations out. And I'm glad I could get them out with a pen and a paper.\"\nAbout three years ago, Lamar was flipping through the channels on his tour bus when he saw on the news a report that a 16-year old named Trayvon Martin had been shot to death in a Florida subdivision. \"It just put a whole new anger inside me,\" Lamar says. \"It made me remember how I felt. Being harassed, my partners being killed.\" He grabbed a pen and started writing, and within an hour, he had rough verses for a new song, \"The Blacker the Berry\":Coming from the bottom of mankind\nMy hair is nappy, my dick is big\nMy nose is round and wide\nYou hate me, don't you?\nYou hate my people\nYour plan is to terminate my culture...But as soon as Lamar wrote, he also started thinking about his own time in the streets and \"all the wrong I've done.\" So he started writing a new verse, in which he turned the microscope on himself. How can he criticize America for killing young black men, he asks, when young black men are often just as good at it? As the song's narrator put it, \"Why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street/When gangbanging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?/Hypocrite\"\nWhen it was finally released last month, the song sparked a rash of think pieces, with some listeners saying Lamar was ignoring the real problem: the systemic racism that created the conditions for black-on-black crime in the first place. Coupled with a recent \nBillboard\n interview in which Lamar seemed to suggest that some of the responsibility for preventing killings like that of Michael Brown lay with black people themselves, some fans thought he sounded like a right-wing apologist. \nThe rapper Azealia Banks called his comments \"the dumbest shit I've ever heard a black man say.\"\nLamar says he's not an idiot. \"I know the history,\" he says. \"I'm not talking about that. I'm talking from a personal standpoint. I'm talking about gangbanging\nHe grew up surrounded by gangs. Some of his close friends were West Side Pirus, a local Blood affiliate, and his mom says her brothers were Compton Crips. One of his uncles did a 15-year stretch for robbery, and another is locked up now for the same; \nhis Uncle Tony, meanwhile, was shot in the head at a burger stand when kendrick was a boy.\n But Lamar says he was taught that change starts from within. \"My moms always told me: 'How long you gonna play the victim?'\" he says. \"I can say I'm mad and I hate everything, but nothing really changes until I change myself. So no matter how much bullshit we've been through as a community, I'm strong enough to say fuck that, and acknowledge myself and my own struggles.\"\nWhen Lamar released the new album's first single, \"i,\" last September, many fans weren't sure what to make of it. A blast of pop positivity that samples an Isley Brothers hit recently heard soundtracking a Swiffer commercial, it felt like an odd move for Lamar, who's known for more complex fare. People called it corny, mocked its feel-good, \"Happy\"-style chorus (\"I love myself!\"). \"I know people might think that means I'm conceited or something,\" Lamar says. \"No. It means I'm depressed.\"\nLamar is sitting in the Santa Monica recording studio where he made much of his new album, dressed in a charcoal sweatsuit and Reeboks. His baseball cap is pulled low over his sprouting braids, and he speaks softly and thoughtfully, with long pauses between sentences\n\"I've woken up in the morning and felt like shit,\" he says. \"Feeling guilty. Feeling angry. Feeling regretful. As a kid from Compton, you can get all the success in the world and still question your worth.\"\nLamar says he intended \"i\" as a \"Keep Ya Head Up\"-style message for his friends in the penitentiary.\n But he also wrote it for himself, to ward off dark thoughts. \"My partner Jason Estrada told me, 'If you don't attack it, it will attack you,'\" Lamar says. \"If you sit around moping, feeling sad and stagnant, it's gonna eat you alive. I had to make that record. It's a reminder. It makes me feel good.\"\nLamar also points out that the fans who scratched their heads at \"i\" had yet to hear \"u\" - its counterpoint on the album. \"'i' is the answer to 'u,'\" he says. The latter is four and a half minutes of devastating honesty, with Lamar almost sopping over a discordant beat, berating himself about his lack of confidence and calling himself \"a fucking failure.\" It's the sound of a man staring into the mirror and hating what he sees, punctuated by a self-aware hook: \"Loving you is complicated.\"\n\"That was one of the hardest songs I had to write,\" he says. \"There's some very dark moments in there. All my insecurities and selfishness and letdowns. That shit is depressing as a motherfucker. But it helps, though,\" he says. \"It helps.\"\nLamar has documented his inner struggles before, most notably on \"Swimming Pools,\" from \ngood kid\n, which explores his past troubles with alcohol and his family's history of addiction. But once he got successful, he says, things got more difficult, not less. One of his biggest issues was self esteem - accepting that he deserved to be where he was. And some of that came from his discomfort around white people\n\"I'm going to be 100 percent real with you,\" Lamar says. \"In all my days of schooling, from preschool all the way up to 12th grade, there was not one white person in my class. Literally zero.\" Before he started touring, he had barely left Compton; when he finally did, the culture shock threw him. \"Imagine only discovering that when you're 25,\" Lamar says. \"You're around people you don't know how to communicate with. You don't speak the same lingo. It brings confusion and insecurity. Questioning how did I get here, what am I doing? That was a cycle I had to break quick. But at the same time, you're excited, because you're in a different environment. The world keeps going outside the neighborhood.\"\nThe week \ngood kid\n was released, Lamar began keeping a diary. \"It really came from the conversations I had with Dre,\" he says. \"Hearing him tell stories about all these moments, and how it went by like \nthat\n\" - he snaps. \"I didn't want to forget how I was feeling when my album dropped, or when I went back to Compton.\"\nLamar ended up filling multiple notebooks. \"There's a lot of weird shit in there,\" he says. \"Lot of drawings, visuals.\" Where as \ngood kid\n was an exercise in millennial nostalgia, \nTo Pimp a Butterfly\n is firmly in the present. It's his take on what it means to be young and black in America today - and more specifically, what it means to be Kendrick Lamar, navigating success, expectation and his own self-doubt\nMusically, the album - at least the half that he's comfortable sharing so far - is adventurous, borrowing from free jazz and 1970s funk. \nLamar says he listened to a lot of Miles Davis and Parliament.\n His producer Mark \"Sounwave\" Spears, who's known Lamar since he was 16, says, \"Every producer I've ever met was sending me stuff - but there was a one-in-a-million chance you could send us a beat that actually fit what we were doing.\" Ali says Lamar works synesthetically - \"He talks in colors all the time: 'Make it sound purple.' 'Make it sound light green.'\"\nBut of all the album's colors, the most prominent is black. There are allusions to the entire sweep of African-American history, from the dispora to the cotton fields to the Harlem renaissance to Obama. \"Mortal Man\" (inspired in part by a 2014 trip to South Africa) name-checks leaders from Mandela to MLK all the way back to moses. On \"King Kunta,\" a stomping blast of James Brown funk, he imagines himself as the titular slave from \nRoots\n, shouting the punchline \"Everybody wanna cut the legs off him!/Black man taking no losses!\"\nHanging over it all, of course, are the tragedies of the past three years: Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Tamir Rice. Says Sounwave, \"To me, the album is perfect for right now. If the world was happy, maybe we'd give you a happy album. But right now, we are not happy.\"\nLamar - who calls the album \"fearful, honest and unapologetic\" - is coy about what the title means. \"Just putting the word 'pimp' next to 'butterfly'...\" he says, then laughs. \"It's a trip. That's something that will be a phrase forever. It'll be taught in college courses - I truly believe that.\" I ask if he's the pimp or the butterfly, and he just smiles. \"I could be both,\" he says\nOn the last day of February, Lamar and two dozen loved ones are gathered at a $6 million mansion in Calabasas, for a surprise birthday party for Sounwave. The estate belongs to \"Top Dawg\" Tiffeth, part of a group of properties so exclusive they're protected by two security gates, the second presumably to keep out the riff-raff inhabiting the mansions inside the first. NBA star Paul Pierce lives across the street, and multiple Kardashians live around the block. There's probably a million dollars in this driveway,\" says Lamar's tour manager, a friendly dude named retOne, as he surveys the Audis, Benzes and Range Rovers out front\nLamar lives down the coast with his longtime girlfriend, Whitney (he has called her his \"best friend\"), in a tri-level condo he rents in the South Bay, on the water. He still hasn't splurged on much: So far his biggest purchase is a relatively modest house in the suburbs east of L.A., which he bought for his parents more than a year ago. Top Dawg says that at first his mom didn't want to take it, because it meant giving up their Section 8 status. Kendrick had to reassure her: \"It's OK, Mom. We're good.\" (\"It was hard times, and we've been through a lot,\" says Kenny. \"But like Drake said: 'We started from the bottom, now we're here.'\")\nIn the kitchen, the girls are snacking and chatting, while the guys are in the home theater watching the new Kobe documentary. In the dining room, Lamar is talking to Sounwave and his manager Dave Free, trying to make last-minute changes to the record that's due out in two weeks\nEventually, Whitney comes in and rests her hand on Lamar's shoulder. \"They're about the blow out the candles,\" she says. Everyone moves into the kitchen to sing \"Happy Birthday\" to Sounwave, and Lamar stands beside Whitney, his arm around her waist. They look happy. Sounwave is about to blow out the candles when someone tells him to make a wish - but before he can, Lamar jumps in and makes one for him. \"I wish,\" he says, smiling, \"for hot beats!\"", "retrieval_timestamp": "2026-01-14T15:21:09.406424", "data_source": "genius_api"}

pack of skittles, nah\nYellow gold, yellow diamonds in the middle, nah\nStand up nigga, I was never known to sit around\n\nWell, as the world spins around and around on its axis\nBoys flip from town to town with the package\nStuffing bills and pounds and browns in a mattress\nSending clowns underground for practice\nThe fact is everybody wanna be the king with the crown\nBut never in the battle when the drama goes down\nEasy to be the boss from behind the wall\nBut we gon' see who really goes down when it's time to brawl\n'Cause you gotta be careful about the image you portraying\nYou gotta

"My back against the wall, like I see y'all frontin'\nDrownin' in your own spit and ain't comin' up with nothin'\nI call this shit \"Rapper Shit\" 'cause I ain't a rapper\nBut if I was, this ain't some shit that I could rap after\nYou caught up in the rapture, you call yourself a factor\nYou're lame, paving a way Bob could build faster\nI'm a real master, real massive, you just real average\nI see your chain, it's strange, they wore those in the Middle Passage\nAnd it's harder to play me than to fiddle backwards\nDon't act like you knew my tactics\n'Cause when it hits the fan, you know I stand last\nI see through your true colors like stained glass\nI see the fear in your eyes when we arrive\nAnd what's the odds of even thinkin' you coincide\nWhen every time a nigga open a door you go inside\nJust to realize either you're weak or someone lied\nSee, you spend more time boasting about what you do than you do\nSo by the time your shit is due it's doo-doo\nAnd who knew that too cool fool who used to sit in the back\nWould slip through the crack, like dudes who went to rehab\nAb-Soul, Abstract Asshole\nBlack Lip Bastard, et cetera for, forever\nI follow no ruler, even if I'm under a drastic measure\nBut whatever\n\nThey say pressure bust pipes\nAnd I ain't never had to deal with plumbing in my life, now that's a bar\nSparring with me like blasphemy to cathedral\nOr colliding with the diesel with your baby in your arms\nYou would test me but you know better\nIt's inadequate to go against the Jesus of Nazareth\nOf the rap game, and guess what, I got no cheddar\nBut my mind is like a wizard\nI defy the laws of gravity every time I get high and write a sentence\nBack teeth never been in agony, but I got wisdom\nI have risen from the wicked to jump on the competition, Scorch ya, third degree burns next to their sideburns\nAll sorts of combustible flows, firemen on speed dial\nFree the leaders of the free world with a freestyle\nFree the teachers, black activists get up off your feet now\nAnd feed off my feelings\nAs I control my wheel like new power steering, so sincere\nTryna duck court hearings but I got big ears\nRap peers, used to study them wishing they would fuck with me\nNow they can't fuck with him, I'm wishing good luck to them\nReluctantly these critics loving me and I don't blame 'em\nThey say, Kendrick you gunning for these niggas\nSo when I pull my weapon out, I give 'em the pleasure to see me aim it\nAnd watch these bullets run into these niggas, clear the set\nI got now, I got next, give you nouns, give you verbs\nGive you adjectives while proposing an agitated threat\nI am most debated in barber shops all because they slept on me\nBig homie fear young, buck cause when I buck I make more than a buck\nDollars come quick like a fucking nun fucking for the first time\nPut me in Alaska for six months in the dark, in my heart I know sun still shine\nStill got a skill to be found in a gold mine\n\nI got an appetite for habitual liars on the mic\nWho with pliers couldn't get a grip on life\nI spit like I sat the tip of my dick on ice, and that's intense\nImagine if I had already came twice, ain't that some shit\nPass the swisher nigga, fill your cup with liquor nigga\nFly your kite till you're gone till November nigga\nShow 'em you remember nigga\nPour some Hennessy and Crown for your homie six feet underground\nSmoke an ounce and turn that frown upside down\nLike the triangle in the panties of my gal\nWhen Mike Jack made \"Raining in Moscow\" I had no style\nTommy Boy stocking on my scalp\nAnd that was like ninety-five, now it's twenty-ten\nTwo years away from when they say the world's expected to end\nAnd I ain't even begin\nThat's more ironic than a bum asking for 50 Cent from \"Many Men\", one\n\nToo many relays for DJs to replay\nI do the reject while I eject your new singlay\nHot enough to sit in hell, then unveil in heatwave\nPiss on a demon with ice water\nAnd if I lose my voice then I'm probably calling out to all P.A\nSystems to assist in with the word I'm tryna spread\nLike county jail bread or the legs of a hoochie\nAnd that's off top like a toupee, I'm 2Pac\nComing back for doomsday, spitting at cops, go and cop my album\nGet high to it, pop some valium, then turn up the volume\nI influence ghettos where it says caution\nAnd them bloggers get to sparking like L.A. females that's balling\nRound the time this happens often, the violence get the flare\nWe racing against life, the turtle or the hare?\nAnd nobody can compare to the legacy that we bout to build\nY'all work at Build-A-Bear soft as underhand pitching with skills\n\nShit, and ain't no use in crying over spilt milk\nYou're dead and gone\nThe pall-bearers carry you and your family will carry on\nAnd on the real, this ain't a construction site but you know the drill\nWe lead the league in all aspects\nAnd we deserve more medals than a magnet\nPut you niggas in a hole like bad debt\nShooting three pointers with the globe, nothing but nets\n\nNigga, nothing but the best\nEvery time we hit your tape deck niggas hit the deck\nI rhyme like a fucking TEC-9\nAnd I 'Clown Posses' if they disrespect\nYou looking at a T-Rex snapping at 'em with Tourette's\nYeah, this the flow that killed aspiring rappers\nToo late, I grab the eight and start expiring rappers\nSome shit only BIG and Pac could rap after\nAnd if they was alive, they would have to pay tithes\nI am God\nM.C.R. squares will disperse in despair, this is me motherfucker", "retrieval_timestamp":

Still, no legitimate answer\nAnyway, I put out a mixtape in 12th grade\nHub City threat, minor of the year, DJ Dave\nAnd his brother designed, put together the music\nPut it out to the people, the people said I was stupid\nWith the flow, went to the barbershop to show off my skills\nMike and Himey and some other cat said I was real\nHimey was Game's barber, the other cat made a statement\nSaying that Game was his partner, so I gave him my tape\nSaid he'd play it for him, hoping that I'd get my big break\nBut never got a response. Anyway\nThis nigga named Pop Gates came to my school with a camera\nI freestyled on his DVD for a minute, then after\nIt hit the streets. I was known as K. Dot from Compton\nMan, Hootie probably was the youngest out that was poppin'\nBut I didn't have a home yet. Hootie had laws in me\nUntil I met Top Dawg, told Dave that he'd like to meet\nMe at the studio, made me freestyle for an hour\nTold me come back tomorrow, but I came back in an hour\nJay Rock was in the booth, recording his first mixtape\nWas skeptical homie at first because he knew where I stayed\nBut we got over that. Heard the beat, wrote a rap\nDid our first collaboration on the Nephew track\nHe got signed months later; Warner Brothers\nWe started on his album, he wrote his rhymes on paper\nBefore Sidekicks became a modern day phone\nSame time, our buzz was generated from G Malone\nHe had a song called 200, White Lightnin', the streets loved it\nSaid that Sony had given him an unbelievable budget\nNow that's a smart nigga. I'm tryna make my raps bigger than life\nBut not knowing how to market it right\nTurned on the radio, only cat new from the West Coast was playin' was Bishop\nAnd by then, this nigga' buzz was tremendous\nIn the lab, me and Rock tryna perfect our craft\nWhat the fuck? Next thing you know, we came across Lift Me Up\nIt was a hit when I heard it, but all we had was the instrumental and the hook\nBut when Rock jump on it for certain, it was to smash\nGave it to Julio, just to get his opinion\nNext thing you know, the record was spinning\nThat was a good look. It set the coast on fire\nNiggas in Garden projects presents Watts Riot\nThen these rappers start hating, callin' up to the station\nAsk why they record ain't playin'. What you niggas complaining about?\nShit was funny to us though\nNiggas hate to see a nigga from the bottom come up, yo\nIn the midst of the single poppin' and niggas tryna seek and destroy\nI had a situation with Def Jam, premature\nShit went sour after Jay-Z left, but I didn't care\nI was glad Jay-Z gave me respect. See, I was young\nFast-forward, Hot Dollah had the streets on lock\nFar as radio play, obvious, he got a lot\nBeefing with Daz Dilinger, Jay Rock spoke on it\nWhich, in my opinion, I didn't think the shit was impo'tant\nBut that's a whole 'nother story. We hit the lab with Game\nAnd a few other names like Juice and Young, ya boy\nDid the cypher freestyle and everybody's like, \"Wow\nThese Top Dawg niggas 'bout to make noise\"\nShortly after, Game took us on tour, I love him for that\nBut right after that, we didn't see him no more\nG Malone came with a smash hit with Akon\nMistah FAB battled Royce Nickel with napalm\nThen everybody start to scream out the new West\nAnd claim that West Coast legends don't want to see him at best\nI think that's just an excuse because their music ain't tight\nTell 'em that Ab-soul said it. They can quote him twice\nThen Crooked I came with Hip-Hop Weekly, killin' the internet\nBut he has been a threat since Death Row. Then, Roccett came about\nAnd all I thought about was Ab-Soul. 2Eleven too\nIt finally started to look like the West was makin' moves\nWestern Union had the whole block boomin' because of Snoop\nMatter fact, Bad Lucc was my favorite about the group\nThen Problem Took off, another Compton native\nWe both Compton niggas, but Compton still ain't made it\nBy this time, Jay Rock and All My Life hit the airwaves\nWe almost got into some major beef over Lil' Wayne\nThat part I'mma leave out\nThere's certain things that the streets only should know about. Shout out to Nipsey\nBishop wins that game, then had a fight with X.O\nThat's when I dropped C4 and had the critics mad at me\nBecause they didn't see my views. Grab the hottest album out and re-do it\nThat's a goddamn power move, stupid\nYou foolish, don't know shit about this war shit\nThere's mo' shit to wanting to be the king of the coast shit (coast shit, coast shit, coast shit, coast shit)\n\nLord have mercy, Jesus Christ\nHe's just nice, he just slice like a ginsu\nLook at the life that I been through\nWe the last real niggas alive, that's official\nLord have mercy, Jesus Christ\nHe's just nice, he just slice like a ginsu\nLook at the life that I been through\nWe the last real niggas alive, that's official\n\nSo, two weeks ago I finally run into the nigga I gave my mixtape too\nAnd said he was partners with Game\nThe nigga finally told me what he said\nHe said he didn't like it\nBut the nigga's like\n\"See? See? Look at you, look at you now. I tried to tell him you was tight\"\nNigga probably never even gave it to him and shit\nShout out to everybody I forgot too\nYoung Thrub bang loose by the local. All my crews!\nTyga and . Big Steel and Eastwood Kboy\nWhat's up with yo crippin' ass, nigga? (DJ Williams my favorite white boy, nigga)\nYoung Roscoe, what's up, nigga? Where you and your brother at, nigga?\nI want to go toe to toe in a freestyle cypher, nigga\nI got 10 dollars on me, wass up, nigga? I'm broke!\nMy nigga Sounwave; my in-house producer\nBest producer of the motherfucking West Coast, besides Terrance Martin\nY'all my two favorite, nigga! Terrance, I'm waiting on you, nigga\nNah, I've been bullshitin', to tell you the truth. I'ma keep it funky\nAb-Soul, I know you mad at me, nigga, but you know where ya rank is at in this rap shit, nigga\nYou know, nigga. You seen the vision, nigga\nScHoolboy Q. Top Dawg affiliates till the casket drop. What's up?\nMe and Rock just came from New York\nNipsey Hustle was out there. I swear to God, them niggas were in the studio\nI just sat back and watched, man\nNiggas looked like the new West Coast Razem\nVibes was like a magazine\nDamn, I'm rapping again\nRappers do that sometimes\nBut straight up, niggas is crazy\nSigning off, K.

{"artist": "Kendrick Lamar", "album": "Unknown", "song_title": "Kendrick Lamar: Rapper of the Year - GQ", "genius_song_id": 264166, "genius_url": "https://genius.com/Kendrick-lamar-kendrick-lamar-rapper-of-the-year-gq-annotated", "lyrics_raw": "Reminder that you can click the images for more annotations.\nEvery member of rap's Mount Rushmore dropped new albums in 2013—Kanye, Jay Z, Drake, Eminem—but it was another MC altogether who stole the crown, and he did it with just a handful of verses: Kendrick Lamar, the latest—and possibly greatest—rapper to come straight outta Compton.\nWe are 10,000 feet above Compton in a private jet, and Kendrick Lamar is explaining to me what happened to him yesterday, when he vanished. We had a plan: Kendrick was going to give me a guided, cue-the-G-funk-synth Star Maps tour of his neighborhood, the one he still more or less lives in, starting at his parents' house a couple of blocks from his old high school, Centennial High, near the corner of Piru and South Central. Instead, he went AWOL. The whole day, no one from his label, Interscope, or Top Dawg Entertainment, the baby \nDeath Row Records that originally signed him\n, could track him down. Kendrick was gone.\nIt turned out he was sitting shivah for a murdered friend he calls his \"little bro\"—a kid from a neighborhood where friendship is defined primarily by neighborhood. A few weeks earlier, Chad Keaton, 23, had been wounded in a drive-by shooting very close to Kendrick's parents' house. He held on for a month but ultimately died of complications from the gunshot wounds.\nSo today, here on board this Challenger 300 seven-seater, en route to New York City's fall Fashion Week, a destination filled with people Kendrick isn't sure whether he wants to impress or fuck with, he's telling me about Chad. \"It all happened when I was overseas,\" he says. \"I had to talk to him over Skype on the hospital bed before he passed.\"\nIt's been a strange year.\n When it began, Kendrick was already regarded as something of a messiah among rap nerds—one of the best rappers ever to come out of the place that has produced many of the best rappers ever—and since then his legend has spread fast.\nIt actually began late last year, when Kendrick's major-label-debut album, good kid, m.A.A.d city,dropped, to universal acclaim.\n The album—about a day in the life of nerdy Compton teenager K.Dot and his homeys as they run around in his mom's minivan chasing \"that crazy-ass girl Sherane\"—is practically a black Ulysses: a portrait of the rapper as a young man, simultaneously a drive-by deconstruction of gangster rap's violent tropes and a celebration of its signature, slow-rolling sound. On good kid, Lamar is our embedded correspondent, spitting triple-time confessionals from a part of the country most of us had forgotten once the rap scene found a fresher inner city to fetishize. He's the game's most linguistically cerebral MC, but also its realest—\nthe one who finds the most vivid way to tell a story about his unemployed buddies trying to rope him into robbing some dude's house\n—and it's this polarity that makes listening to King Kendrick feel like you're putting on the illest 3-D glasses in hip-hop. The music nods at influences far beyond the West Coast—\nBeach House samples\n, Dungeon Family lushness—but throughout, his voice stays singularly focused on a twenty-block radius around Central Avenue and Piru Street:If Pirus and Crips all got along They'd probably gun me down by the end of this songGood kid, m.A.A.d city sold an industry-shocking 241,000 copies its first week and went platinum this summer. \nThen, in August, Kendrick snuck a sixty-four-bar Trojan horse into his buddy Big Sean's song \"Control\"—a guest spot on a song that didn't even make the final record.\n \nAfter Big Sean goes on for a while about drinking champagne in Detroit,\n Kendrick wakes up the entire hip-hop universe, calling out nearly every single young rapper in the game: \nDrake; A$AP Rocky; J. Cole; Tyler, the Creator; even Big Sean himself.\n The dude slaps Sean on his own song. He also proclaimed himself \"the king of New York,\" which to certain East Coast ears sounded like a Greek dude strolling into Troy and dropping a deuce on the tomb of Hector.\n\"Control\" leaked on YouTube late in the day on August 12; for a solid week, it was the biggest story in music. Just a few weeks after that, Kanye announced he was touring solo for the first time in five years and that his opening act would be Kendrick Lamar.\nKendrick's career momentum has created a dissonance that must look surreal from 30,000 feet. Chad Keaton's memorial service was held just before Labor Day weekend; Kendrick attended, then flew straight to a show in Alaska. Next it was on to Vegas to perform at a pool party. He only made it \"back to the set\" to grieve for a single day, the day we were scheduled to talk. \"It can be complicated and confusing,\" Kendrick says of his life right now, funerals for murdered friends one day, private jets to fashion parties the next. \"From my perspective, it's not just I'm famous—I still live in this world.\" And when someone back home needs something, \"I still gotta get that phone call.\"\nIt's clear the emotions are still raw. Kendrick is a small guy, just five feet six, and with his black hood pulled up over his head, a chain around the outside of his sweatshirt, it felt like I was talking to a wizened rap Jedi. After about an hour of questions, I gave him a break, and he lay down on the couch to rest. Just kind of curled up with his back turned.\nA bit later, I saw a tweet from him to his 2.4 million followers pop up on my phone: \"When the cameras stop rolling, it doesn't mean real life will follow.\"\n Instantly it had fifty-six retweets. After one minute, 600. After two minutes, 1,000. \nThen he tweeted a picture of Chad: \"Rest N Heaven my Lil bro. Watched u become a man. U fought bro. The city stole yo life, but not your legacy.\n\"On the night of the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards, just as the heat over \"Control\" was peaking, I tailed Kendrick through the backstage maze at Brooklyn's Barclays Center. At one point, he ran into Drake, and they wrapped each other up in a big hug. It was their first encounter since Kendrick called him out on \"Control,\" and of all the slaps in that verse, this one felt the most personal, \nbecause Drake had helped break Kendrick, handing the kid not just a verse but an entire song on his second album\n. After Drake's VMA performance of \"Hold On, We're Going Home,\" Kendrick made his way back to the greenroom, crooning the hook: I got my eyes on you.... He caught mine and smiled. \"You watch,\" he joked, \"I'm going to be singing by my fifth album!\"\nI asked if this meant things were cool between him and Drake. He paused. \"Pretty cool.\" Shrugs. \"And I mean, I would be okay if we weren't.\"\nA month later, it became apparent that things between Kendrick and Drake were definitely not cool. After Drake's new album dropped, he gave a pair of interviews in which he sounded wounded by the \"Control\" thing: \"You can't just say that and then see me and be like, 'Yeah, man, what's up?'—pretending like nothing ever happened.\" Seemingly in response, during the BET Hip-Hop Awards cypher a few weeks later, Kendrick freestyled: Nothing been the same since they dropped \"Control\" / and tucked a sensitive rapper back in his pajama clothes.\nI got Kendrick on the phone after the BET taping, and he admitted to being surprised by Drizzy's public lash-out—\"Control\" named names, sure, but at its core it was a backhanded tribute to the peers Kendrick actually gives a shit about. Most of them took it in that spirit. Not Drake. \"Yeah, I guess he took it as a dis,\" Kendrick said, downplaying talk of a beef. But he was also clear that he doesn't look up to Drake, doesn't see him as any kind of creative influence. When I asked if Drake was a mentor or a role model, he replied quickly, \"No—peer. If anything. We all peers.\"When Kendrick Lamar was 21, 2Pac appeared to him in a vision. Before you roll your eyes, Lamar wants you to know that he's not the hermit-on-the-edge-of-the-Nitrian-Desert, vision-seeing type. He knows how this sounds.\n\"I was coming from a late studio session, sleeping on Mom's couch. I'm 26 now—it wasn't that long ago. I remember being tired, tripping from the studio, lying down, and falling into a deep sleep and seeing a vision of Pac talking to me. Weirdest shit ever. I'm not huge on superstition and all that shit. That's what made it so crazy. It can make you go nuts. Hearing somebody that you looked up to for years saying, 'Don't let the music die.' Hearing it clear as day. Clear as day. Like he's right there. Just a silhouette.\"\nThe visit from Pac changed Kendrick's connection to the world he was chronicling in his music and compelled him to think more carefully about who was listening to it. \"It wasn't just about money, hoes, clothes, drinkin',\" he explains. \"I mean, I come from that world, but at the same time, I started to realize that there's people out there that can't really connect to that lifestyle. They're in the struggle.\"\nMuch of Kendrick's music now is an attempt to transcend his ravaged world without separating himself from it in judgment, about somehow gaining control over his household's chaos—some of his uncles were Crips, and his father was reportedly a Gangster Disciple in Chicago before moving to Compton—and over his neighborhood's warped commitment to adolescent pride. It's an ethos that extends to his crew. They have a seriousness of purpose, a rigorous discipline that can feel slightly monastic at times. \nKendrick doesn't smoke weed or drink booze.\n In the time I spent with him, I never witnessed anyone roll even the thinnest spider leg of a jay, nor did I see Kendrick so much as glance at the many, many girls around him. \"When I ask OGs why there's so much division in the streets—nobody never really knows,\" he says. \"But you know one thing that everybody always mention? A woman.\"\nA few hours after the VMAs, we were back in Kendrick's hotel room and everybody was in a lull, staring at cell phones, waiting for news about afterparties. A plan coalesced to hit a party being thrown by Diddy at the Dream Downtown hotel. But one of Kendrick's Top Dawg boys leaned back and said, \"Aw, man, I can't go to no club.\"\nKendrick spoke up.\n\"We have to go.\"\n\"Look at you! We have to go. You're never we have to go.\"\n\"You know me,\" Kendrick explained. \"I only go when there's a point. Usually the point is just niggas drinking. But walking through the club the week after I released the 'Control' verse? That's a point!\"\nTwenty minutes later, Anthony \"Top Dawg\" Tiffith, basically TDE's Suge Knight, asked if I had had a fun day. I said that I had and that I was surprised by their discipline. \"You guys seem so calm,\" I said.\n\"Well,\" Tiffith told me, \"we're going to have to call it a night with you, because we about to get uncalm. You understand.\"The gossip from Diddy's Ciroc Amaretto Launch Party/VMA Afterparty sounded like it fell out of a massive tear in the mid-'90s West Coast-East Coast time wave. Bloggers breathlessly recounted a surreal scene at Dream: booths packed with hip-hop illuminati—Jay, Bey—\nmouths agape as a wasted Diddy, incensed by the \"King of New York\" boast, attempted to pour a drink (Ciroc Amaretto, presumably) over Kendrick's head, only to be thwarted by Jay Z acolyte J. Cole, who was kicked out in the ensuing chaos.\n Naturally Kendrick himself refused to corroborate any of this. \"It was all love at that party,\" he told me on the private jet.\nAfter we land at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey, I catch a ride with Kendrick into Manhattan. His show tonight is a New York Fashion Week kickoff party in Chelsea thrown by industry doyenne Jenné Lombardo, and in the car he goofs around, imagining the horror he and his Compton homeys could inspire: \"We invited Kendrick Lamar, not K.Dot and them Piru niggas.\"\nBy the end of his forty-minute set, the crowd is pretty fucked-up. There's chronic in the air; models are tottering in their heels. When Kendrick launches into the call-and-response for \"Swimming Pools (Drank),\" a song about his family's dark relationship with chemical dependency—Head shot. DRANK. Sit down. DRANK. Stand up. DRANK—a wraithlike six-foot blonde with a white veil dances around a little coven of models. There is something demonic about the scene: Kendrick recounting his fever dreams about the grim consequences of decadence while presiding over a decadent Fashion Week party.\nIt's hard to guess how scenes like this will change Kendrick and his music. Sometime in January, he will step into Top Dawg's booth again, and he expects to be just as surprised as the rest of us by what comes out. \"I don't know,\" he says. \"It depends on where my emotion is. How angry I'll be, or how happy I'll be, or how confused I'll be.\"\nAt one point on good kid Kendrick raps, \"I can feel the changes / I can feel a new life / I always knew life can be dangerous\". The biggest change in Kendrick's life is the inversion of rap's consummate observer becoming the observed. How will all eyez on him affect his art? Because he's already 10,000 feet above Compton, and rising.", "retrieval_timestamp": "2026-01-14T15:36:48.574032", "data_source": "genius_api"}
