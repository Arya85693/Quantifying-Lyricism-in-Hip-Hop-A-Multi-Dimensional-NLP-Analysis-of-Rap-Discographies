You don't even believe in Christ\nWhat you sayin' wallahi for? You ain't been on your din, you've been eating swine, nah\nI ain't the man of your dreams, now you wish that you stayed with your previous guy\nIt used to be 3.5s, now I can sell out the O2 arena twice\nDon't ask what the fee looks like\nDon't believe all the media hype, like eighty percent of these people lyin'\nWho can I ask when I need advice?\nI gotta work hard, it's me who provides\nEmail YBeeez for the feature, look\nWhat goes up must come down so when you're in the air, prepare for the landin'\nI did everything that I could for my hood, so how do they say I don't care for the mandem?\nCrib so big I might get out of breath if I walk too quick up the stairs in the mansion\nThey weren't there for the action\nTryna round up three hundred Spartans, we goin' to war but we ain't in Athens\nEverything won't go to plan, that's not how it goes, I'm afraid shit happens\nRap boy on a footballer's wage, I'm on the same pay as the players at Dallas\nWhat's makin' the haters jealous? I'm thinking the AP's eighteen karats\nThey call me my government name in Harrods (Uh)\nThis one ratchet, don't even know who her baby dad is (Nah)\nIf I cum inside, then I won't leave 'til I see her take the tablet (Nah)\nHe mention my name 'cause he wanted some fame and he ain't established (Huh)\nAlright, you know the verse gon' hit when you hear that adlib\nCome a long way, I was sellin' them opium on my lonely, but I'm not Ken Carson\nAnd my hood red hot, red dot on my head, in my hood, I'm a target\nSo driver, stay in the whip while I jump out quick, don't park it\nI can lean out the window and horn it, I'm on the same pay as the players at Charlotte\nBig fish in this ting, no armbands like a backstroke how I swim in that shark tank\nDrop me in the jungle, tree-to-tree, start swingin' like Tarzan\nTwenty-four inch on the rims on the Benz, I'm doing donuts and skidding on tarmac (Huh)\nSick of these high-rise buildings, flip the script, now I'm livin' on farmland (Huh)\n\nHmm, grr\nAlright\nAlright\n(Hahaha)", "retrieval_timestamp": "2026-01-14T16:30:29.174387", "data_source": "genius_api"}

it's a two-man operation\nGranted, the fact that we one man short\nGot love for him, he can watch this new man stop a nation\n'Cause handlin' crack is a one-man sport\nInstead of dress-up, I walk in sweatpants and charms clinkin'\nI find a girl, we step dance and calm drinkin'\nThe face, the breast, the bras, the toes\nI'm still solo, and a long night draws to a close\n'Cause it's a fact, if she come to the crib and I get some ass inside\nWe'll never talk again, scary and true\nThat song, Special I, recorded with Voyce, well, it's like a classified\nIt's what I'm lookin' for to carry me through\nYet I can't seem to find it, every girl that possesses it\nOnly wants a friendship, causing me to forget the shit\nAnd when they talk about they past and lovers\nAnd you get mad at the thought of it giving ass to others\nYet you find peace with yourself, now least there's some room to ride\nThere's also Room For Improvement as soon as June arrive\n\nStrolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spring\nStrolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spring\nStrolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spring", "retrieval_timestamp": "2026-01-14T16:41:37.907984", "data_source": "genius_api"}

It's hard to believe that eleven years later all three of us would come together the visual for her song called \"Work.\"\nToday the world knows Little X as Director X, they know me as Drake and not the kid singing while you order pasta. But eleven years later, they still know Rihanna as the one and only, Rihanna.\nCaptivating from day one, the iconic being that is Rihanna was already at a place where most artists only dream of going. For them, that's often the peak, but for her, that was a starting point, as she has kept ascending to an untouchable level ever since.\nWhen it comes to music, she relentlessly takes over the charts with every release. When it comes to performances, they swarm in masses just to be in her presence... obviously... And when it comes to fashion and style, she makes it seem so effortless until you try to do it yourself, which is when it gets a little awkward.\nWhat's most impressive isn't the endless list of stats, awards and accomplishments. What's most impressive is the person. Some artists need to play a character to achieve success, some need to downplay their own natural instincts to blend in. She succeeds by doing something that no one in this industry does, which is being herself.\nThis woman has surpassed all competition while still being the same girl from Barbados, surrounded by the same friends, speaking with the same accent and never missing a crop over unless it's to come and perform at OVO Fest. We love the music which can change styles from album to album. We love the videos which change their artistic vision from year to year. But most of all, we love the woman who hasn't changed since day one.\nShe's someone, she's someone I've been in love with since I was 22 years old. She's one of my... she's one of my best friends in the world. All my adult life I've looked up to her even though she's younger than me. She's a living, breathing legend in our industry.
