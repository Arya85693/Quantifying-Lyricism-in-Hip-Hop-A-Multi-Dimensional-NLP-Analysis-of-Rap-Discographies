America\nYou see, one in every one hundred Americans are locked up\nOne in every nine Black Americans are locked up\nAnd see, what the white guy was trying to stress was that\nThe money that we spend on sending a motherfucker to jail, a young motherfucker to jail, would be less to send his or her young ass to college, huh\nSee, and another thing the white guy was stressin' was that our jails are populated with drug dealers\nYou know, crack cocaine? Yeah, stuff like that\nMeanin', due to the laws we have on crack cocaine and regular cocaine\nThe police are only, I don't want to say only right, but, shit\nOnly logic by riding around in the hood all day\nAnd not in the suburbs because crack cocaine is mostly found in the hood\nAnd um, you know, the other thing is mostly found, you know where I'm goin'\nBut why bring a motherfucker to jail if it's not gon' stand up in court?\nBecause this drug ain't that drug\nYou know, level three, level four, drugs, shit like that, haha\nMhm, I guess it's all a misunderstandin'\nAnd um, I sit back and think, well, shit, us young motherfuckers, you know, that one in every nine\nWe probably only sellin' the crack cocaine just because we in the hood, and it's not like your suburbs\nWe don't have the things that you have\nWhy? I really don't want to know the answer\nBut, I guess we just misunderstood, huh?

Hahaha\nYeah, well you know what?\nDon't stop the track, that's the good weed\nYou know what? I have a fucking daughter, you understand me?\nAnd why the fuck would you bring my neighbor to jail just because\nThe reason why he live next door to me ain't the reason why I live next door to him?\nMeanin', he didn't rap his way to my fuckin' neighborhood\nHe sold crack cocaine to get to my neighborhood\nYou move him out, bring him to jail for life, and then, you move in a sex offender, hahaha\nThen give me a paper, haha\nIs that a misunderstandin'? 'Cause I don't understand it\nAnother thing, let me take my glasses off 'cause I want to see the reaction on the faces when I say this\nUh, Mr. Al Sharpton, here's why I don't respect you, and nobody like you\nMhm, see, you're the type that gets off on gettin' on other people, haha\nThat's not good, no homo, and rather un-human, I should say\nI mean, given the fact that humanity, well, good humanity, rather\nTo me, is helping one another, no matter your color or race\nBut this guy, and people like him, they'd rather speculate before they informate, if that's a word, haha\nYou know, 'spec before check, anyway\nMeanin', I'd much rather you talk to me first and see if you can learn an opinion before you make one\nJust my thought of good humanity, Mr. Sharpton, haha\nHold on, I ain't finished with you man\nGotta pluck the ashes, mhm, hold on, um\nMr. Sharpton, and anyone like you, you don't know me\nSo, if you're not gonna try to, then what you say or think about me, or whatever I do, is totally Casper the Friendly Ghost to me\nAnd, it doesn't make you a good person to criticize before you improvise\nDoesn't necessarily make you a bad person neither, but the characteristics fall heavily into bad's way, haha\nBut, since I am human, I am good and bad as well\nBut I try my hardest to stay good\nAnd some of the things I do and say may be bad, or just not too good, haha\nBut I do try, so with that said, I don't fault you\nI mean, you're only human, good or bad\nBut I also don't respect you, and I don't care if that's good or bad, haha\nYou see, you are no MLK, you are no Jesse Jackson\nYou are nobody to me\nYou're just another Don King with a perm, hahahaha\nJust a little more political and that just means you're a little un-human than us humans\nAnd now, let me be human, by sayin', fuck Al Sharpton, and anyone like him\nFuck if you understand me\nI love bein' misunderstood, haha, why?\n'Cause I live in the suburbs, but I come from the hood\nBring the hook in\n\nI'm just a soul whose intentions are good\nOh, Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood", "retrieval_timestamp": "2026-01-14T19:53:36.668187", "data_source": "genius_api"}

vacations\n\nYeah, it is what it is\nMy niggas just killed y'all and I'ma close the casket\n\nI'm trying not to let this industry get the best of me y'all\nI work hard for the fame, the game's stressing me y'all\nAll they do is complain what they expect from me y'all\nFrom the hood to Hollywood they respecting me y'all\nAnd even overseas they accepting me y'all\nAll the ladies show me love, the thugs repping me y'all\nI get a lot of dirty money so expect me to ball\nBut I'm saving all my checks, I'm investing 'em all\nThey say, what goes up is gon' definitely fall\nEven the stars, but success is my destiny y'all\nLook, I cook tracks I got the recipe y'all\nYou can't name another cat that can mess with me y'all\nAt the shows all the hoes be molesting me y'all\nI got broads crying

the problems that arrive is God testing me y'all\nSo I pray everyday but I ain't praying too much\n'Cause I be sinning everyday so I ain't praying enough\nAnd we all could be beat, and I ain't saying I'm tough\nBut if it's beef I don't speak, I ain't saying \"What's up?\"\nIf it's beef when we meet then I'm spraying shit up\nPrraat prraat, I ain't saying too much and that's that\n'Cause that cat you embracing with love\nMight clap that gat 'cause he got hate in his blood\nKeep your friends at a distance and your enemies close\n'Cause the folks you call friends tend to envy the most\nSome cats'll hang themselves if you give 'em a rope\nBurn the bridge and don't give 'em a boat, let 'em sink\nSometimes you gotta give 'em some some time to let 'em think\nBut sometimes you gotta give 'em the 9 and let 'em stink\nYou can't bring every horse to the pond and let 'em drink\nI'd rather keep my eyes wide open instead of blink\nAs soon as your eyes shut, them niggas'll ride up\nAnd the guys that you trusted be getting you tied up\nAnd we all gotta die but, I ain't ready to leave\nThat's why even if it's petty I'll be ready to squeeze\nBut put a cheddar in cheese, the guac-a-moola\nI pop

Howthony Whattano here, the Internet's busiest music nerd, and it's time for a review of the new Lil Wayne album, Tha Carter IV.\nYes, here we have a new commercial record from veteran game-changing New Orleans rapper Lil Wayne, adding another addition to his legendary Tha Carter series with the sixth installment, obviously.\nNow, looking at the current day rap landscape, you maybe wouldn't know it, but there was, in fact, a time when Lil Wayne was considered to be one of the best and was definitely one of the most popular rappers walking the planet. Originally cutting his teeth as a protégé of fellow New Orleans rapper Birdman in the '90s on his Cash Money record label, then really making a name for himself in the mainstream as Wayne developed this otherworldly talent for freestyling, dropping numerous hits and classic albums in the process, like Tha Carter III.\nIt's also important to know that around this time, Wayne's capacity to rap on and about seemingly anything helped him achieve this massive amount of output, as when he was at his peak creatively, he just went on this just insane mixtape run that was truly unparalleled at the time.\nSo even if Lil Wayne isn't topping the charts in the way that he used to at one time, he was truly a pioneer for a lot of stuff that we just consider to be normal in the current day rap meta now. From his flow to the way he embraced this casual use of autotune as a bit of a vocal enhancer to his approach to recording his songs and putting them together in the studio. And he's really inspired everyone out there today, from Kendrick Lamar to Drake to Young Thug, to even young up-and-coming rappers who don't really understand that a lot of Wayne's ideas and impact – it's just the air that they breathe.\nNow, with all that being said, like I alluded to earlier, Wayne's popularity as of late has... waned. And sadly, Wayne is not really taking the paradigm shift with a lot of grace. As, recently, there has been tension between him and Kendrick Lamar over the fact that Kendrick was chosen to perform at the 59th Super Bowl that happened earlier this year, clearly nailing down the spot due to all of the hype surrounding the recent W that he took in his massive beef with Drake. Super Bowl 59, though, was set in New Orleans, and given just how much hip-hop has been getting ushered into these his halftime shows as of late, I think a lot of people presumed, including Wayne himself, that he was going to be a shoe-in for this performance, and yet he wasn't.\nWayne had feelings about this. He voiced them publicly. This led to a lot of discourse and dissatisfaction among rap fans. So all of that is much of the lead-up to the release of this new installment of Tha Carter here.\nI should also mention that it's been quite a while since Wayne has released a full-length commercial project that even begins to hold a candle to Tha Carter III. So I went into this new record wondering if we were going to potentially head back to a level of quality and focus that that album brought. Especially with maybe a newfound need for Wayne to prove he still got it.\nAnd look, I'm not going to beat around the bush with this review. This album was pretty bad – not just bad, but shamefully bad at points. Bad form, bad ideas, bad taste, bad execution. The album doesn't even have the decency to be bad in one single way.\nLike with the first big full opening song on the record, \"Welcome to Tha Carter\", which is like this soul chop boom bap combo that honestly sounds really classic, very throwback. Wayne's flows are solid, but upon closer listening, it's pretty apparent that whatever the soul samples are that are getting thrown into this track, they're AI generated. As you have the singers on the track singing about Tha Carter and the album we're about to experience, which is just a bit much, especially considering that lyrically, this track very much feels like your very standard array of Lil Wayne one-liners.\nFollowing this, we have \"Bells\", and I actually love the beat on this one a lot more. It's like this late '80s B-boy banger. Wayne actually sounds awake on this one, too, flow-wise. I would say it's a highlight on the album, if not for the lyrics dropping off in quality on the back end of the track, especially around lines like\nAnd I don't smoke bunk, I only smoke that strong\nEyes tight like my name Wong-Ding-Ding-Dong\nI thought these like \"I'm so high, I look Asian\" lines died over a decade ago.\nBut as weak as the initial leg of this album is, it feels like gold in comparison with the drop off that happens around track five, where we get this dramatic, heavy, acoustic guitar-based instrumental, paired with very whiny chorus vocals from Jelly Roll, of all people. The vibes on this one, like you could guess, go together like Sour Patch Kids on pizza.\nThe track \"Banned From NO\" has a very promising first verse, though. The whole vibe of it feels like classic raw mixtape Wayne. But what makes this track lackluster is that it's really padded out with a lot of chorus, repetitions, and refrains that make it so that Wayne doesn't really need to write that much on the track.\nNow, what's even more surprising than the Jelly Roll appearance, and frankly, even worse, is the track \"The Days\", which has Bono on it. Yeah, Bono from U2. The whole thing on this track, it just sounds like this stale 2000s pop rock rap crossover cut that would be placed on a Fast & Furious soundtrack or something.\n\"Cotton Candy\" with 2 Chainz, sadly, doesn't save the record after this. Despite the fact that 2 Chainz and Wayne have made multiple tracks together over the years, they couldn't both sound more unenthused. I'm not even sure why the song is on here. It could be a leftover from one of their collabs.\nThen \"Flex Up\". I can see the vision on this one. It's got this moody lo-fi beat with this linear driving intro that's building up to a dramatic crescendo. But Wayne on this track, much more here than anywhere else on the album, just sounds so high out of his mind and slovenly that he can't really nail the vibe of the instrumental. He just feels like he's on autopilot.\nThen there's \"Island Holiday\", which I don't even know where to start with this track. I mean, point blank period, it sounds like shit. This track sounds like shit. I'm not just saying that because the track is a horrendous interpolation of Weezer's \"Island in the Sun\". But there are multiple portions of the song where it just sounds like Wayne has five or four different autotune layers of his voice all singing in unison, and they are not in harmony at all. I don't understand why you would layer four or five song vocals on top of each other and not have them be in harmony or key or anything. It just sounds like Wayne is singing any random fucking note, and they're just piling them on top of each other for no reason. Yeah, I mean, really the worst way you could treat a song that, frankly, is not even one of my favorite Weezer songs. I'm not even in love with this track, and yet he ruined it for me.\n\"Loki's Theme\" is yet another very odd detour on the album because of this weird metal outro. It feels like I'm listening to a Linkin Park from Temu.\n\"If I Played Guitar\" is this really annoying acoustic number where Wayne tries to get super emotional and crooning with the autotune over some very melodramatic chords. Not to mention the whiny bull crap chorus, where Wayne's knack for lyricism just doesn't translate over to a piece of music of this style.\nIf I played guitar the way you play games with my heart\nI'd play you a fucking song that hit like Sylvester Stone\nNext, we have \"Peanuts 2 N Elephant\", which, honestly, for me, is a highlight. It's got this weird quirky-ass beat that sounds like an instrumental from a Super Nintendo game from the '90s, or I don't know, if you could 16 bit-ify that piece of music that plays in Looney Tunes when something's happening in a factory. Apparently, it's produced by Lin-Manuel Miranda. Over this instrumental, Wayne is like his old self. He's just rapping a bunch of kooky, silly one-liners, getting playful with it. Again, this reminds me of an older version of Wayne when he was out here proving that \"I'm a rapper who can rap on anything, who will rap on anything. No matter what the instrumental is, I will sound entertaining, I will sound confident, I will sound out of my mind.\"\nYeah, the track is certainly that. But I don't think this song is going to hit for many people, considering that I feel like the context in which this song would work best is surrounded by a bunch of incredible tracks and bangers and some of Wayne's best material to date. I feel like a song like this would serve as a detour in that tracklist. People would be like, \"Oh, he sounds like he's having fun on this little silly one over here. Okay, that's cool.\" But instead, what you have here with this track is one goofy ass moment standing among all of these just completely awful, awful cuts. It just feels like insult being added to injury. There's so much effort is going into a track that sounds like it's straight out of a fucking Wile E. Coyote cartoon.\nThe song \"Rari\" is a somewhat cute crossover with his son Kameron, where he does his thing on the hook. I suppose this is one of many mainstream, endearing father-son, father-daughter collabs we've seen in mainstream rap lately, which in concept are cool and I think have led to some neat and fun moments on some big records. But in this instance, it just sounds some weird independent SoundCloud producer just took a Wayne a'capella and remixed it with a Kidz Bop cover.\nThe song \"Maria\", believe it or not, sees Wayne rapping over \"Ave Maria\" with Andrea Bocelli's vocals going off in the background and everything. It sounds terrible. It sounds awful. This is an idea that I think everyone would have thought was novel on some level in 2002, but we're not in 2002. It's more than 20 years after 2002. There's nothing novel or interesting or refreshing about this, especially given just how lazily and messily it's assembled.\n\"Bein Myself\", while I do think the sentiment of this track is cute, there are multiple tracks on this thing that make this song hard to stomach, including the one where Wayne is talking about peeing on himself.\n\"Mula Komin In\" sounds like a very awkward and painful attempt at doing something current, which, considering how influential Wayne is to the current world of rap music, you think he would do a better job of being able to map over onto it, but he doesn't.\n\"Alone In The Studio With My Gun\" is this pitifully sad attempt at a pitifully sad song. It features mgk and Kodak Black, too. It's just too angsty for words, and everyone on this song is too old to be doing this track. I'm going to say that.\nAnd \"Written History\", while I do appreciate Wayne really trying to sum things up on this album and make a statement here on his impact and the legacy he's leaving, I just feel like this is a painfully inconclusive closer for a record that, frankly, is just so deeply unsatisfying and accomplished pretty much nothing outside of just solidifying the belief of a lot of people that Wayne just does not have it anymore, that he does not have it.\nYeah, I feel like that's all he's achieved and confirmed with this album, which is why I'm feeling a strong 1 to a light 2 on this thing.
