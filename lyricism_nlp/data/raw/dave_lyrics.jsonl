Man, I was so excited\nThat I replied a minute later, that's that \"Bro, I think that you just let her know\" excited\nToo excited, no clue on what I should do excited\nSo I'm just typin', ramblin' like a fool, excited\n(Look, look)\n\nAnd we were talkin' for hours over some minor things\nIgnorin' everyone else, to her, I'm replyin' quick\nThis type of chick, she got a spark like you were lightin' spliffs\nYou know you like her when you're thinking about your words\nShe got me typing, deleting my messages then re-writing\nIn the hope that there's a smile when she's replyin'\nThe highlight of my day, them phone calls in the night, it's the little things\nThe girl, she had a vibe and I liked it and\nShe's into photography, she's got a passion for it\nAnd she respects that I'm rappin', but she ain't cattin' for it\nSee, that's the perfect balance, there's nothin' better than\nA girl with talent, drive, ambition, all of them things above\nShe's showin' in abundance, I ain't even met her yet\nShe works around the corner but lives just outside of London\nI ain't frontin', I'm a sweet boy, intentions are in question\nSo my compliments are decoys, if that even makes sense\nThe first time I met her, I'm surrounded by my friends\nRandom ends on some staircase, so much for a first date\nI just had a show and I asked if she could meet me after\nMaybe we could chill, you never know where things could go\nNo problem, she down to roll, travelled in the cold\nSo I went across the road, grey hoodie under her coat\nIf I'm rememberin' correctly, it's always kind of weird when\nA person that you were texting's a person that you're obsessed with\nI was on her from the jump, I think she was wearin' pumps\nOr Vans when I first met her, know it's either either one\nShe was lookin' so attractive, I barely saw skin\n'Cause she was covered like a mattress, man, I think that she's the one\nI was stuck for twenty seconds tryna to give the girl a hug\nAnd all my friends are drunk, so fuck it, I'm 'bout to kiss her\nAny complications, I'm blamin' it on the liquor\nChangin' my name on Twitter and blockin' her on my Insta\nI saw her skin blush the moment that our lips touched\nShe pulled my bottom lip until it stretched\nKissed me on my cheek until she reached around my neck\nAnd had me moanin' like a bitch, even though I'm wearin' jeans\nI had to re-arrange my dick so she don't see that I'm erect\nIt's the first time we met, got me feelin' like a creep\nAnd that strawberry flavour gave her tongue a kinda sweet little taste\nAnd we could speak about anything, we were friends first\nI dropped her to the station, I remember\n'Cause we had a conversation for ages about our dreams\nAnd the things that we hadn't seen and all that we had intended to do\nI bet she's hopin' my intentions are true\nAnd as months went by we both got into it and intimate\nAnd I'ma spare you the details 'cause both of our parents are probably listenin'\nBut really we were into it, into us, into this\nInto everything about each other, we were lovers\nAnd I love her 'cause she knows me and that's probably why she told me\nYou ain't ready for a girl, you're still a little kid that's gettin' ready for the world\nAnd you don't need that kinda burden, but I told her that I want it\nAnd I'm just being honest, yes, I know that girls exist, but I don't see them as a problem\nI meant every single word and I ain't gonna lie and say DMs have been absurd\nBut out of every single girl, this is the weirdest of positions\nIt's usually the girl that's askin' where I see her fittin' or a place on her position\nBut I'm tellin' her I need it, and I don't think she sees it\nSo I'm being even sweeter when we're speakin' and we're meetin'\nI've got affectionate messages, you could read them\nYou gotta tell a girl that she's beautiful till she sees it\nBelieves it, understands it more than physically\nMentally, and the way that I'm feelin'\nI could talk for ten years about the moments that we shared\nThe jokes that we had runnin', the places that we been\nThe music we made together, producin' next to my bed\nThen makin' my minor changes in reference to what she said\nI think I started gettin' tired, my schedule's a mess\nReplies are gettin' lazy and my lady knows it's crazy\nBut she's there if I'm in need while I'm at shows gettin' tempted\nBy girls that are on their knees, you know I'm only a teen\nIt's like my eyes started driftin', not as easy as I pictured\nTo give your all to a woman, ignorin' all this attention\nThat's been gettin' to my head, the sex is so accessible\nOne message or text and girls will get in your bed\nShe's tryna make it happen with photos at her events\nI mention it's her passion, photography is her thing\nAnd I don't know if it's the pressure where paper meets the passion and the pleasure\nWe all gotta work to survive\nSo now she's popping up at shows, takin' pictures on her own\nAnd at first, it wasn't cool but, fuck it, we'll let it go\nUntil I saw her in some rapper's tracksuit, I felt a way\nShe told me it was work, and she was in some studio takin' pictures, and I just sighed\nSome halfway-wannabe rappers had fed her lies, they ain't lookin' for no picture\nI know it's your profession but read their intentions\nThey ain't payin' male photographers to shoot that same session\nAnd I felt so disrespectful, standin' on her dreams\nAnd crushin' 'em, I just told her it's nothing, do what you need to do\nIf I ain't feedin' you, then my opinion's\nAll I'm givin' when I speak to you 'cause I don't have the right\nWhy should girls be punished for a male's dirty mind?\nWhen I think about it now, I'm ashamed to the core\nI mean how many men stop their women from achievin'\nWhat they can because in secret they been feelin' insecure?\nAnd I can't handle my emotions\nIt's probably why I didn't see her talent when I shoulda been supportin' and promotin'\nLike I didn't have a platform, a voice and a followin'\nWith everyone I knew, I really coulda done a lot of things to help chase her dream\nBut instead of me to grow into the person that she needs, I acted like I couldn't see\nAnd I don't mean to say this like I don't trust the girl\nBut how can I trust her if I don't trust myself?\nAnd even girls can get tempted, you know how it goes\nWhat if she meets a bigger rapper when she's at a show?\nWhat if he sees her backstage? What if he's sellin' lots?\nWhat if he's got a bigger car?

Then rah\nTurn Chris Benoit\nHave him hit from far, nah\nFill 'em up with bricks and glass, nah\nMy young G's will grip, then blast\nHave you tried in the street\nFuck findin' my feet\nI could ride, but it's better when I'm ridin' a beat\nMy emotions are peak, it ain't a sign of defeat or the weak\nI would **** you, then cried in my sleep\nDropped Juss two racks and told him, \"Buy the machine\"\nI'm LeBron in Miami, I provide for the heat\nGod strike me if I'm lyin', I ain't cryin' in this beef\nUnless the tear's comin' tatted on the side of my cheek\nI provide for my peeps, the Lamb' white in the seat\nSo I'm literally a wolf disguised in a sheep\nYou have five-figure dreams, I have five-figure sleep\nFive hours more than enough time that I need\nMan want a fair fight, but I ain't on it when we see him\nFuck honour, this revolver is onomatopoeic\nLet it stut-tut-tut-tut-tut-tut-tutter when you see him\nFree Scalez, Free C and free my niggas till I see 'em\nI wouldn't wanna be 'em\nMy OG's roamin', I don't need a Colosseum\nYou see it?\nSo I'm playin' it good, let hood politics stay in the hood\nFuck the internet, you see this new generation\nThey're Insta'-beefin' and I ain't into speakin'\nWhen I ducked down\nI had him runnin' in a Lyft like he missed a meetin'\nThere's no good reason to risk your freedom\nThe yutes dem snitch and them bitches sneakin'\nShe don't wanna talk 'bout friendship\nShe just wanna deal with the pipe like I'm fixin' leakin'\nAnd sleep with a legend like Chrissy Teigen\nWhere I'm from, the word \"Life\" has a different meanin'\nMan smile in your face, but them niggas schemin'\nTry involve me in a flakey dealin'\nSistine Chapel, I'ma paint the ceilin'\nI've been violated and I hate the feelin'\nThat's why nowadays, man hates the preachin'\nWe smile in the visit, cah we ain't defeated\nThe Supreme Court's where my mates appealin'\nI can't breed that girl, that's torture\nSouth London, it's just slags on the corner\nAnd influencers tryna bag them a baller\nShe a gold digger, I can tell from her aura\nHer socials say princess, she a pauper\nWhen it's time for it, need more for my daughter\nCall me a talker, but man are gettin' lined like lambs in the slaughter\nIt's life-threatenin' and I can tell from the borer\nCut through a nigga like a knife through flora\nFeds got the guys on a case and they stalk us\nIt's a conspiracy, like tinfoil hats and a new world order\nTouch me, you better have a life insurer\nBloodthirsty, I got sharks in the water\nAnd trust me, I know a killer well, no orca\nHave you ever seen a nightmare brought to life?\nWhere I'm from, you get cheffed on a normal night\nMan talk on my name, but it's porky pies\nI'll really put it in a prick like a porcupine\nLittle bro wanna save for a .45\nGo board a flight, there's more to life\nYutes on the M6 all the time\nWe don't need TfL for a northern line\nAll the best politicians been taught to lie\nWhere do they buy cocaine when they're snortin' white?\nAre their dealers safe or on the borderline?\nIt's ironic, cah we don't know where to draw the line\nMan see \nBlue Story\n, they're mortified\nMan see \nScarface\n and it's glorified\n'Cause when you're Black, everything gets scrutinised\nThat's why they call it \"Urban\", it gets euphemised\nSouth London, man are gettin' euthanised\nI see a yute's demise, I wasn't too surprised\nHe got soaked, but his right-hand scuba dived\nDon't die by a sword that you used to shine\nYou can drown for your king, you don't know about Ophelia\nCah we got iron, I don't know about anaemia\nI took the hard road, we don't know about the easier\nOne bag of whores and drug paraphernalia\nWhen ends got sticky, had a flicky with Emelia, I mean Olivia\nThis ain't Libya, this ain't Syria\nYou act sillier, we let it seep in your skin like Nivea\nWho Wants To Be a Millionaire, I won it\nNever done a gameshow or trivia\nI done Wandsworth, Erlestoke visitor\nI done Springhill, Grendon, Swinfen, Whitemoor, Swaleside, Brixton visitor\nI done M-way trips, done shit that I wish I never did\nBecah I could have been a prisoner\nIs this the shit that appeals to the listeners?\nRoad ain't no amazin' life\nThe ends full of snakes and jail's just a waste of time\nI tell my young G's, \"Take your time\"\nFuck Jazz, you could really see a major nine\nYo, I'm so ashamed of how I used to get figures\nMan sell you a dream like the road ting's lit\nAnd then they leave out the parts where you're buryin' your niggas\nOr in jail, wonderin' who's puttin' dick inside your Mrs\nI'm so fuckin' determined\nI was in intensive care when I was born, mummy fell down the stairs\nWhether I was gonna live or not was somethin' uncertain\nI used the word \"Fell\", with the commas inverted\nYou see, growin' up I had it far from perfect\nBut nobody did, so I'm a normal person\nI gotta be grateful, we all have demons, and all see angels\nOr maybe it's me\nA Black yute's more than a face on a screen\nA number on a laptop or name on a sheet\nWe got stories to tell and got places to be\nFrom my heart, that's the makin' of me\n\nI was selling, look, I was selling tomatoes\nI sat pon my two hands\nI struggled 'cause I didn't want to suffer again\n**** I just wanted, it just make me so upset\nThree times, I tried to come here\nI went to Hanover, they sent me back\nI tried so much, he has not seen anything yet\nI was in detention camps for months and years, I didn't give up\nI was not even twenty when I left Africa\nI was determined to survive\nI was determined to succeed\nI didn't know anybody, nobody was ready to help me\nEven when you were born\nYou were six weeks old, this one is not even Africa, it's this nation\nI was on the streets for three years\nI have three babies in my hand\nNobody let me in, nobody in this nation\nI couldn't pay my rent, deported gangsters carried—\nI didn't give up, I carried my babies everywhere\nAnd now this is how **** pay me back for all those pain that I go through\nEvery day I lay in my bed, I'm in pain\nYou see what he's doing to me\n**** want to kill **** want to kill me",

income, my boyfriend left me\nSo how the fuck am I gonna survive when this kid's born?\"\nAnd I said, \"It's a blessin' as mad as it is\nAnd Les, I never even knew that you were havin' a kid\"\nBro, she's four months pregnant, young and neglected\nSingle, but I don't think she wants to accept it\nSo she's still textin' exes, tryna get this\nBack on track, but I don't think that she gets it\nIt's emotional obsession, clinical depression\nLife is a lesson\nAnd you ain't gotta sit and cry\n'Cause, Lesley, livin' in this gift called life\nThere's no better gift than the gift of life\nSo can you handle it?\n\nI don't know myself\nI don't know myself no more\n\nBut that changed her perspective\nLate in December, her baby's expected to drop\nShe's accepted, excited, electric, pumped\nOnly gotta wait a few months\nHer and Hannah had lunch, told her she's pregnant\nAnd they're the closest of bredrins\nSo she didn't stunt to tell her, \"I think that it's an error\nYou ain't a mum for a day, you're a mum forever\nWhatever, and you and Jason break up whenever\nIf I'm honest, that's somethin' you should have done together\"\nShe doesn't know that her and Jason goin' out again\nAnd Jason doesn't know that Lesley's carryin' a child for them\nShe had daydreams of settlin' down with Jason\nBetter 'cause now they're together, it's wild\nFeelin' like she needs to call her friends and tell 'em 'cause while\nShe's lettin' 'em down, but most of them are never around\nShe calls Hannah the next day\nStill tryna figure out the best way\nTo tell her that she's gettin' back together with an ex-flame\nSo she left her a voicemail\nLike, \"Yo, Hannah, it's Les, can you call me back?\nI wanna talk about the baby, you, me, Jason, all of that\nI been feelin' like I need to get my aura back\nI used to be so fucking confident\nBut these days, I swear that\n\nI don't know myself\nI don't know myself no more\"\n\nIt's 3:30\nLesley was meant to get a scan, but today, I think she's goin' home early\nTryna talk to Jason, tell him 'bout the kid\nAddressin' any reservations, have that conversation\nMiddle of the summer and it's rainin'\nWaitin' at the train station, hella cancellations\nSo she gets a taxi, sittin' in a backseat\nBlue jean jacket and a maxi\nActually tired and her legs are achin'\nTouched the destination\nWay faster than the cab driver's estimation\nShe put the key in the door\nShe couldn't believe what she see on the floor\nSome size-five trainers, ragin'\nTears in her eyes, but it's cool 'cause they must be the neighbour's\nAnd Jason's in the bedroom fully naked\nLesley runnin' up the stairs, but she's makin' noise\nAnd she can hear Jason's voice\nSayin', \"Hide in the closet\", but he's made his choice\nSo she bursts in sayin', \"What kind of person\nWould cheat on his pregnant girlfriend?\"\nJason sayin', \"What the fuck? You're pregnant? What the fuck?\nYou weren't even gonna tell me, I mean, what the fuck?\nWhat do you want from us?\nNah, you ain't in love, you just wanna love\"\nLesley tellin' Jason, \"I don't wanna love\nI don't want a you and I, I don't want a us\nAnd also, I don't wanna talk loads\nOne more line before I dash like Morse code\nOpen the wardrobe\"\nAnd Jason's on the edge\n\"I just wanna see if she was prettier than me, slimmer than me\nMaybe your baby's similar to me\nMaybe you wanted someone thicker than me, fitter than me\nTo satisfy you quicker than me\nI got your baby in my stomach and you did this to me\nWhat did I ever do to you for you to finish with me?\nI didn't believe my girls, but they were thinkin' of me\nAnd give it to me, the wardrobe, give me the key\"\nI was pullin' at the door, but Jason's bigger than me\nLiterally, I remember viscerally\nJason pullin' from behind me, now he's grippin' on me\nWhite flashes, eye gashes, when he's hittin' me, see\nI just wanted to disappear, I wasn't livin' for me\nPhysically, I shut the fuckin' door as quick as can be\nHe's outside askin' why I made him do what he did\nUsin' a kick to open up the room that I'm in\nI'm feelin' afraid, barricaded with a chair in the handle\nI'm hearin' sirens, I just wanna run away, but I can't\"\nJason's gone by the time police have come and they saw\nThat there ain't no one else in the house and feds are runnin' through the door shoutin'\n\"We have reports of an argument with a woman\"\nThere's blood all over the floor and it's splattered onto the wall\nLesley's on the bed and she's tryna speak to the feds\nShe's deep in the stress and it's meters above her head\nIf anything, she couldn't even say anything\nBut she's got this really sharp pain where her belly is\nSo they call a ambulance, Lesley didn't plan for this\nPolice are in the room tryna find the missin' piece of the puzzle\nUntil they stumble on somethin' that's kind of random\nIt's a phone in a wardrobe\nIt had five missed phone calls from Jason\nAnd also a couple other numbers, so they're thinkin' that it's no help\nUntil they play the voicemail\nLike, \"Yo, Hannah, it's Les, can you call me back?\nI wanna talk about the baby, you, me, Jason, all of that\nI been feelin' like I need to get my aura back\nI used to be so fucking confident\nBut these days, I swear that\n\nI don't know myself\nI don't know myself no more\"\n\nShe felt sick to her stomach, she started panickin'\nMind rattlin', tryna understand what Hannah did\nBattlin' the shame 'cause the situation embarrassin'\nShe's tryna fathom it, betrayed by her own garrison\nMeanwhile, she's on the bed tryna manage this\nPiercin' pain in the stomach, she couldn't handle it\nNow she's waitin' for an ambulance\nLook\nAnd I know she's strong\nBut when I heard about what happened, I was over-shocked\nHer nose was gone, her jawline shattered and rocked\nThey said her baby was the reason she was holdin' on\nShe's dozin' off, doctors gettin' no response\nHer heart rate slowin' down and they don't know what's wrong\nPicked her up, got her out the home\nAnd onto the stretcher for good measure, but she's fadin' out, uh\nShe took damage to the brain and now\nShe's in a coma as we speak, but I ain't sure if she can make it out\nYou see, this time that I'm takin' out\nTo tell you this story, it's more than a song or track\nIt's a message to a woman with a toxic man\nI'm beggin' you to get support if you're lost or trapped\nI understand that I can never understand\nAnd I ain't sayin' that it's easy but it must be right\nSome of your sisters, aunties, mums, or wives\nAre fucked inside and they will never touch on why\nI'm touched 'cause I've seen women that I loved or liked\nCry a little red tear through a bloodshot eye\nThis shit's awful, no matter what culture, it ain't normal\nMen try and twist it and make it seem like it's your fault\nIn that train full of people that you're takin'\nHow many Lesleys are runnin' from their Jasons?\n\nAngel without wings\nLike the day without the night to bring her peace\nA song without a voice\nA spark without a flame\nA child without a name\nOh, it's just wrong\nLike an ocean without a shore\nA soldier without a war\nHow can we do this anymore?\nA song without a voice\nA spark without a flame\nA child without a name\nOh, it's just wrong\n\nWell, we've made a massive amount of progress in this last year, haven't we?\nFeels like a long journey\nAnd I must say it's been a pleasure to watch you mature and grow in thought\nAnd in your career and life\nYou've opened up immensely\nI'd be lying if I said I wouldn't miss these sessions\nBut you know, you can never stop learning about yourself\nSo you're always welcome\nI'm just happy you're at a place now where you feel\nYou understand your emotions and are in control", "retrieval_timestamp": "2026-01-14T14:30:26.831417", "data_source": "genius_api"}

ex has got ivory skin\nWhich is funny 'cause it's really the elephant in the room\nIs that enough reason to bury me in a tomb?\nI fell in love with an Albanian, I know it's mad\nWe're not together 'cause her family would hold us back\nI saw the red flags, I wouldn't want my child to grow in that\nRum and Red Bull, it's a culture clash (Fuckin' hell)\nI don't wanna let life tear us apart\nI see

travellin' every day\nNerves paralysin' when you get to stage\nYou feel love for an hour, and then it gets to fade\nImagine what that does to your mental state\nImagine bein' a millionaire at a tender age\nYou don't even know whether to spend or save\nMy mum had to grow up fast, she expects the same\nI was twenty with a mortgage and rent to pay\nSo what's happenin'?\nI got guerillas all around me, allow me\nDon't get grabbed in a party or lack in it\nYou'll die for a wine like Joffrey Baratheon\nPattern 'em\nThe government ain't gonna help with all the issues that I'm tacklin'\nThe way you talk

the story behind it\nWe all know loss, but there's glory behind it\nI'ma make a film for my mum\nAnd tell her, \"Tell to the world, this album is just the soundtrack\"\nLook at her story in a year in her life\nAnd tell me if it doesn't bring a fuckin' tear to your eyes\nIn this together\n\nI thought wishin' wouldn't hurt, but take it over\nI'm done holdin' at your lies\nSo knowin' that it weren't

Would I be frontline? That's what I'm thinkin'\nIf I was alive in the 1912 on the Titanic and it was sinkin'\nWho am I savin'? Am I fightin' women and children, or am I waitin'?\nI wonder, \"What would I do in the next generation?\"\nBattle of Karbala, if they capturеd me for the sake of my fathеr\nWould I stand on my honour like Hussein did and then tell them to make me a martyr?\nWould I read, get smarter? Forgive my oppressor, stick to the creed?\nIf I got locked inside like Nelson Mandela, but never was free\nI see a white man dance to rumba, ain't study Patrice Lumumba\nBut get on the stage and sing like sungba, lajaja-ja-ja, sungba\nFuck it, I wonder, \"What would I do in the next generation?\"\nWould I fight for justice?

What am I doin' in this generation?\nI get in my head sometimes, I feel like I'm in despair\nThat feelin' of total powerlessness, I get that sinkin' feelin'\nThat good ain't defeatin' evil\nI put their pain on vinyl, but feel like that shit ain't movin' the needle\nRetweetin' people, raisin' awareness, in all fairness\nAin't gonna bring Chris back to his parents\nBut there's no other option, it's a process\nGotta stand and protest cah they want man silenced\nCah they want man dead or they want man hopeless\nIn the next generation, I spoke with my ancestors in the night and I showed them\nThey spoke with tears in their eyes for the brothers they lost and said it was progress\n\"How can it be progress?\" I asked them, confused, disgusted\nThey said, \"David, just so you can fight this, you know how much sufferin' touched us?\nAnd you got a chance, we come from a time and a place where you couldn't get justice\nHad to find peace in the fact that we all answer to the one what we trust in\nAnd in our generation, we did do peaceful protests, just like you\nBurnt buildings, just like you, did boycotts, just like you\nSat in a hostel powerless, did feel powerless just like you\nAnd I know that it may sound strange, but we made some change and we're just like you\nI know that you question your character, I know that you suffer in silence\nI know that it don't feel right when you go to the club in Victoria Island\n'Cause how can you dance in the club?

new prime minister\nHow'd you have a heart so sinister?\nHow are you so wasteful when people are dying in Somalia\nAfghanistan, Egypt, Libya?\nThe irony is we have no business in Syria\nBut kids are getting killed for all the business in Syria\nAnd then they try and tell you that it's ISIS, it's ISIS\nIn their attempts at killing it, how many civilians\nDied, so what's the difference between us and them?\nWhen you got drones killing kids just touching ten\nThen when a bomb goes off, every politician's lost\nLike that last strike that didn't kill a hundred men\nYou ain't the same as them\nBut all that fuel for the fire is what you gave to them\nAnd what you take from them\n\nAll my life I know my mum's been working\nIn and out of nursing, struggling, hurting\nI just find it fucked that the government is struggling\nTo care for a person that cares for a person\nSo where's the discussion on wages and budgets?\nHow they made them redundant when I was a young'un\nThe letters in our car said my mum was overdraft\nBut somehow I still had dinner money in my pocket\nAnd even the little things like ordering pizza\nWere probably the reason for overtime in the evening\nFive till ten, six hours of sleeping\nFor 22 years my mum was doing the cleaning\nDreaming that her kids would have a better life\nGo in bed at night, struggling with getting by\nThat's the reality for millions of people in a nation\nWhere a lot of us were looking for a second try\n\nA question for the new prime minister\nAnd please, tell me if I'm being narrowminded\nBut how do we spend so much money on defence\nAnd weapons to wage war when the NHS is dying?\nBursting at the seams, and what about them people\nThat voted for us to leave for the money that it would see?\n350 million we give to the EU every week\nThat our health service needs\nBut now them politicians got what they wanted\nCan you see an empty promise or a poster on the street?\nNurses in tears 'cause they're working every hour of the week\nAnd they still don't have the money that they need\nYou brought the heart of the nation to its knees\nUnderpaid, understaffed, overworked\nAnd overseen by people who can't ever understand\nHow it feels to live life like you and me\nPatients lying in the corridors\n'Cause doctors can't even find a bed for them to sleep\nI remember A&E and all them sickening screams\nOf a little girl waiting for a surgeon to be seen\nPrivatized healthcare, guns for police\nIncreased uni fees, is this what they're selling us?\nWell let me remind you just in case you've forgotten\nThat we live in Great Britain, not in Donald Trump's America\nSpeaking of America, state and the president\nWith all due respect, I've got something to say to them\nI just find it funny you can't give a hand to Palestine\nBut you can trade whole arms with Saudi Arabia\n\nLook, look\nI've got a question for the new prime minister\nAt Grenfell Tower, your response was ridiculous\nYou hid like a coward behind your 5 million\nDodged responsibility and acted like you're innocent\nAnd I can see you're terrified, you're not good at telling lies\nI'm getting why you stay away from everything that's televised\nYou look like a robot and you don't speak with any life\nIt feels to me like any guy in press could've said them lines\nImagine going to the council for the safety of your block\nAnd you've got kids but they're ignoring you at every time\nEveryone who knew about that cladding\nShould really be going prison under rule of joint enterprise\nBut if it ain't a little kid with a knife\nI bet that judge is going easy when he's giving him time\nThey don't deserve to be free\nAny builder, MP that knew about the conditions but did it to save cheese\nWhen I listen to the things that the residents had seen\nI was so shocked I couldn't even speak\nFamilies they know that had died in their sleep\nHow you choke on the smoke when you're struggling to breathe\nThe glow from the fire\nThe panic when you hear all the sirens\nThe crackling, the popping and the muffled-out screams\nThe fear in the eyes of a man that was trapped\nWho jumped 15 floors from the tower to the street\nI could only hear a fraction of the pain and the grief\nClosing my eyes, trying hard not to cry\nAnd the joy and relief in the face of a man\nWhen a woman from the flat said his neighbour was alive\nNo help from the council in keeping any list\nOr the people that survived, his neighbours and peers\nAnd for that whole meeting I could see that he was trying\nSo his smile was an island in a sea full of tears\n\nLook, I've got a message for our old prime minister\nDavid Cameron\nI mean you fucked us, resigned, then sneaked out the firing line\nI wanna know how you managed it\nAnd are you bathing in the sun while them papers have a run\nAt the woman that you left here to handle it?\nYou gonna teach your little lad to be the man that's got a plan\nAnd then the moment that it fails to abandon it?\nAre there bullies in his school?\nAnd when you pick him up after class, can you feel his embarrassment?\nI mean you never gave a fuck about the youth and that's the truth\nThere's no sympathy for you or your cabinet\nI really wish I could've seen how you were scramblin'\nWhen you lost the referendum that you had to win\nI feel like politicians are all addicts\nIn a big fat game but it's lives that you gamble with\n\nI've got a question for the leader of the Labour Party\nJeremy Corbyn, where do you wanna take the country to?\nHonestly, I wanna put my trust in you\nBut you can understand why if I've got trust issues\nDo you really have the faith of your party?\nDo you really have faith in the party that will come with you?\nAnd how do you plan on keeping all the promises?\nMan, if I'm being honest, sir, I'm struggling to get with it\nI just ain't getting it\nEverybody's great until you get them into office and then guys start forgetting things\nProve to us you're different, don't promise me anything\nGo and get justice for Rashan Charles and Edison\nAnd if you haven't had the thought to vote yet\nOr protest 'cause you don't really see the progress\nI hope you know that what they're saying is affecting us\nThe small steps are way better than no steps\n\nWe have to accept responsibility\nFor our own actions and our politics\nYes, politicians are all humans\nWe do make mistakes, we have got to learn\nHonesty, accountability, transparency\nFaith in the youth today\nIf we accomplish that, there may be hope for the human race\nThere may, there may be hope for the human

I put in so much time for what?\nThe fame don't impress me, I'll still get active\nLike Jet Li, I'm tryna stay balanced like ah, music is a myth\nAnd every song I make is getting easier to stray from the message that I bring to the table, you ain't eating if your friends ain't eating with\nDickheads, '09 take me back\nI lost two grand last week and didn't make it back\nAnd teachers wonder why I don't work well\nI'm broke as hell\nThe music made me known as well\nSo I invested in crow and shells\nCause where I'm from, you slip, you're getting poked as well\nSo, bun General Asad, we're a bag of rebels\nThis crow's got a bag of bass and you're a bag of treble\nHow can I listen to a man who ain't playing when you talk about the game from the side like Gary Neville\nI'm involved, I'm on a pitch, I'm a centre mid\nI don't need to send for kids\nI'll turn up where your college or centre is\nAnd send you six\nYou dickhead, I've let so many violations slide G\nGuys don't like me\nAnd now they wanna get a name and waiting with a bitch like try me, try me, try me, try me\nAnd watch what the outcome is\nI'm a mix between Heath Ledger and Malcolm X\nOutspoken but I don't make sense\nCause one day it's put the knives down or put the peace signs up, the next day I'm at your home instead\nAll for my pride and respect\nI bought my man a Tek\nThameside days getting calls at like 9, it's a mess\nI put time in my craft, an hour in my coursework and nine in my bars\nYou don't know about grinding my dog\nI put my life in my art\nMy life on the line for my marge\nReal rap, she put life in my heart, I give nothing less\nIf the truth hurts, I like being lied to\nI can't deal with issues in the ways that I would like to\nIt's funny how I've always got a text to reply to\nThat's why I went and got three lines, that's a Haiku\nParanoia got me stressing, man I'm thinking that they're planning SLR, I've got a cannon\nI ain't taking photos, I'm aiming at your bros and taking shots like Tenerife\nThen I'm out the door like I just got a shot for 10 of each\nPride will be the end of me\nI'll just lose my cool and lose a tool over petty beef\nYou couldn't comprehend it G\nLife has been an F-ery\nColour scheme's grey\nGot me questioning my God and all the times I've said grace\nWretch Miller, I set pace\nI've ducked yutes down, I had to run the same day\nAsk Serg, ask Temmy, I'm just venting on a low\nAnd me plus four might just turn up at your show\nMe watching in a venue, man we're leaving with your soul\nI ain't tweeting little hoes\nI need my P's to come and grow\nAll these catties on the roads, in and out, they come and go\nFor a month they wanna know\nSo I send them to my bros\nWho gives a damn about my age, watch my energy and flow\nI give none of it to girls cause the one I have is special, like a lover and a friend to me\nYou send for her, you send for me\nLet a girl try it, man a chick can catch fire like Katniss Everdeen\nNo chicks can catch fire like any one of my ex girls\nMe, I couldn't breath, I needed space, that was ex hell\nHow can I wish my ex well, I've still got ex hate\nBryson Tiller I was tryna see my ex change\nI'm Scott Summers now, nothing but an ex man\nStill tryna test my brain in the A.M, that's an exam\nThen it's on to a next man, still scarred by my ex hoes\nCould show her true colours in a photo, that's an expose\nSo how could you ever bad me? I had my brothers and I never had me\nHow could you ever bad me?\nIf I made 6 bills I gave my right hand 3, and told my brothers no snitching\nStill I, got some good friends I couldn't put in that position\nDoes it mean that we're neek so we're different, cause my G's have ambition\nPast the streets we see past the image\nCause you're the last friend by the grave of the prison hall\nAnd you're the first friend to tell 'em to be a criminal\nThe young G just died you're wondering why\nIt was you who gave him drugs and a knife, it was you\nIt was you and now your pissed because he caught another case\nWhen you practically walked him to the gate\nBe careful who you step with\nYour gang, they were talking to your grave\nThe road I'm walking is a maze, six paths like the sage\nHad me in and out of raves, with a flicker on my waist\nTo give a fuck if it's winter I'll catch him slipping in the rain\nAnd my man thought that I was slipping on the train\nBut he's pissed because I've always got a dipper or a chain\nI ain't a witness to the jakes\nI'm tryna put an image in the frame for the lyrics that I've written on the page\nThe way I'm living isn't fake\nThem man wanna G check me, but can't do it to my face\nCause I've got killers in the cage\nShow, party or a rave I bring gorillas on the stage\nThere ain't a rapper or a singer in my lane, a musician in my league\nYou man wouldn't believe that we've lost half our G's to jealousy and greed\nAnd me I think it was the weed, cause them boy there fell off\nThe same guys that used to come around and eat jollof\nWe're in country making no profit, 2 grand off of cash points making no losses\nAnd if they put me in a station then it's no comment, no comment, no comment\nThey can keep me to the sunrise, from littering to gun crime\nThe code that I live by I die by\nMan you give your life for you can get skyed by, served like a drive by\nYah I meant drive thru like how? what? why? who?\nTake you off the map and have your mother thinking why you\nI've done so much wrong just so I can make the right move\nThey're still tryna draw me out, these yout's need to sort it out\nNo one believes the stuff you claimed to have done\nYou're on Snapchat, I'm on Radio 1\nWhat don't you get about this?\nI made my mummy smile\nI took myself to uni man I made my mother proud\nYou was in and out of town doing, cunch for an older, probably didn't see a pound\nYou want beef I give cows, better yet I give herds\nAsk Jussy, ask Serge\nI'm the realest guy around, so bang your doors up and down\nThat's when Whitemoor, Swaleside, Belmarsh, Isis, Acat, Lifeus, Skells and yea\nYou know the rest innit\n\nFree my brothers\nGet me\nMan like Santandave\nOi Charlie, let the beat run, let the beat run, we're gonna run into the next one fam\nJeez\nOi, shout out my brothers\nYou, my friend, are an absolute beast cuz\nMan's 17 you know\nShout out to Rel on the production man\nOi\nOi, my brothers\nOi\nGet me\nJeez\nCertain rappers calling my phone already saying enough already man, enough already\n\nMy mum, she taught me to be self sufficient\nShe always said to put power in your self\nShe shared her hours and and her wealth, so I could stand here and share this wisdom\nWorked 3 jobs and a little wage, from her youth to her middle age\nAnd that was all so I could study right and live okay\nWhen it was Cookham Wood and Littlehey\nI know my mum she didn't break\nStill 4:30 dinner made\nLets talk about your system then\nLets talk about our place in here\nLets talk about our prisons then\nWhen we're so stuck in London people blind we only see the ends\nOut of 63 million, blacks only make 3 percent\nAnd we have no say, when you think, cause you refuse to vote\nLike Conservative policies ain't been a problem for the yutes on road\nAnd Rapz is doing law\nHe sat down on the floor and watched it, 2 members of a jury, in a court\nPlaying naughts and crosses bored as hell\nThey gave him guilty in that court as well\nDidn't focus on the case, but he's in jail I guess that all is well\nNo incentive to pay attention for a jury the system didn't pay\nWhen most of them are bored, white, out of touch and middle-aged\nLike \"What on earth's a stabbing?

in hand, my money's in cards like Match Attax\nHow I'm drawn, I'm fucking confused\nI'm struggling to keep up with man who got nothing to lose\nI can't shank man and go jail, I got way too much potential\nBut I'm facing niggas that'll skrrt up in a rental\n'Cause they wanna go jail\nYeah, they need ratings\nNo future, it's frustrating\nSo how I draw hate, bruv I'm fucking confused\nMy brother still writing to me, I dropped tears on that letter\nPSG do what ever Marseille\nYou got something to lose\nBut nothing to prove\nAnd that's the realest rap that I ever fucking wrote\nI can demonstrate broke, I need digits in my world\nI had bailiffs waiting like I was picking up my girl\nNo talking in the station, real niggas never tell, nah\nThem niggas onto us, them pussies follow us\nBlade brown disciples, bragging bout who buys fools\nI hate it, I hate my own name shit\n'Cause when it comes on, I never like what David\nStill, I put the base in balls like Babe Ruth\nNiggas call me Blackbox like an old school game cube\nBack for the cypher\n40k on my Blackbox\nFeeling like a hero, in my college I was Hancock\nBut I'm cool\nI don't need all the views\nJust a few real niggas and my brothers out them fucking prisons\nThem dickheads don't believe me\nThis rap scene needs me\nMy teachers weren't surprised, they said this music ting was easy\nFrom when I spoke about my dad and Ms Wiles used to cry\nI put my soul in my rhymes, I never do this for the hype\nListen\nMandem\n\nBeen trying make you see what I can\nIt's talking to the deaf, describing colour to a blind man\nI was putting hundreds in my cupboards, it was light fam\nMan forget I'm 16, brother I'm still nice fam\nI was talking grands from a yungin'\nHad plans from a yungin'\nScreaming RIP Gran from a yungin'\nI never had a penny for a patty or a dumpling\nI was chasing catties, chasing patties for a pumpin'\nI was just a brace face, Dave never had a name to him\nWe had a skatty little spinner, and it never had a name to it\nNow everybody's got rambos and jangos\nBlade pushing through tee's\nNow brudda watch your man go\nBlade pushing through tee's\nNow brudda watch your man go\nGloves for them spinners, that was Kangol\nI was 15, I never banged goals\nI banged visits like lawyers\nMy brother said see ya and I wanted a tom like Sawyer\nMy teacher was a MILF, so that pain was getting milked

shot, that's a tough grind\nYou spot one by spot one on the front line\nWhen the race gets tekky, I've got to run mine\nThat's the story on road and my love life\nYou've got the young G's pressuring the older kids\nYou ever felt like somebody's gotta go for this?\nFeds follow me and my associates\nI gotta take a hard left, we're the Soviets\nI never waited for a bring in or the lottery\nI wanted to make moves, but it's fucked\nCah the worker in me always seems to argue with the boss in me\nNobody made change, stickin' to the policy\nNobody's speaking for the youth, and it bothers me\nThey said I'd either do crime or be a rapper\nI managed to do both, so I'm a self-fulfilling prophecy\nI'd told bae, \"You're Penelope of my Odyssey\"\nRolex Daytona with the white face\nMan trappin', get

Forreduci\nPeople wanna use me, don't wanna lose me\nDifferent place\nGirls say I'm a different person any given day\nHow you talkin' on my name with that little wage?\nThey threw shade on my borough before the Insta' page\nIt's got me fightin' myself\nHalf my guys in the cell, they denied any bail\nIt was time for a ride, and I was ridin' as well\nI'm Lord Petyr Baelish, I've got knights in the Vale\n\nI'm outside where it's deadly, and I ain't singing medleys\nTop-floor views, tryna figure where my head be\nSupreme box logo\nAnd I ain't at the marches, but this ain't my first rodeo\nWas better than your favourite rappers now\nWhen I used to spend my profit on Polo\nBefore the 'rona came, it was high-key on the low-low\nBox cutters for the packages that's comin' through the door\nSend a memo to the tugs, \"Is you coming to the war?\"\nCah the weapon we select never left the shelf\nThe feds can't protect us, so we protect ourselves\nWhy I'm rapping 'bout pain they ain't never felt\nIt's trapping early in the morning with Vanessa Feltz\nMy brothers do lunch in Amiri denim\nWhile I'm waking up from dreams seeing fairies in 'em\nYou said I ain't top five, had a big laugh\nAnd rappin' weren't the only way, I had six paths\nHaving visions of the future, seeing cocked machines\nAnd now we in the future, we got nuff machines\nWhen I was making classics, they was watchin' Beans\nHad the Submarine, now I ain't ever seen a submarine\nUsed to dream of big houses with a swimming pool\nMJ and Scarface posters in the living room\nBut we got to teach the kids about the principles\nHoodie, gloves and mask like Victor Doom\nLove the handle on the spinners 'cause it grip rubber\nBut never touched another man because of skin colour\nHow we treat these women bad, and they still love us?\nGotta do better, so they can heal for us\nAnd every other day, she tells me I'm so talented\nBut my life's upside, I gotta balance it\nGetting money now, I hardly check my balances\nAnd shoutout to my manager because he managing\nLate night, say a prayer while the candle lit\nBut this Balenciaga Paris made me arrogant\nShe came round wrapped up like she Arabic\nMight seduce her to some Usher, can you handle it?\nMy juvy still a teen, wanna cop a range\nWe ain't never own a thing, I said it's not the way\nLocal opps tryna drill me from a block away\nSaw it before it happened, felt like Doctor Strange\nAnd right now, I'm holding business with Santan\nAnd I ain't talking 'bout loans or a bank scam\nI'll gobble up a contract like I'm Pac-Man\nSomethin' like track and field, how the cash ran\n\nUsed to break down squares, playin' Xbox\nMy last verse probably paid for my next watch\nCah the rap game remind me of the crack game\nI walk into a cypher like it's a pet shop\nMy niggas in a sin bin, he got sent off\nAnd went off for the team, that's the end of\nRain, hail, sleet for a ten shot\nEinstein, we were working for a dead prof'\nI got both 'cause I'm indecisive\nBut I been around teef like gingivitis\nThey gon' 'member trilly, like they did the titans\nRunning through the bramble like that nigga Titus\nAnd we ain't washed up, but we clean good\nBefore sticks, we kept the mace like Greenwood\nI know the man are asking, but the team's good\nMy niggas ballers off the drugs, they didn't need snus\nAnd we good, you know the guns and the butter\nBut I ain't want much, I give the funds to my mother\nTrue to the oath, I'ma bring it to my grave\nWe in a different grade, this is Jimmy and Dave", "retrieval_timestamp":

He lays out his fears most explicitly on \"Selfish\", another James Blake joint, reeling off a litany of sins and self-suspicions over ominous chords and haunting vocal samples. \"My 27th Birthday\" underscores his inner conflicts across almost eight minutes of restrained piano and hi-hat-centric percussion: new money clashes with old, moral conviction with the ethics of consumption, work ethic with the sacrifice of ambition. The state of the world weighs heavy; \"How can you be King?/How can you be King?/Don't speak for the people,\" he asks on the title track, closing out the record with a powerful interrogation of his own commitment to social justice and a sage reminder that the push for change is a collective, intergenerational effort.\nThe introspection is admirable but the album's highlights occur when Dave steps outside of himself, whether it's to position himself as a narrator-unpicking the psychology of a criminal with \"Marvellous\", calmly outlining the reasons women may fear men on \"Fairchild\"-or to engage with his peers as on the sultry Tems teamup \"Raindance\" or \"Chapter 16\", which sees him form an inquisitive dialogue with grime heavyweight (and Top Boy co-star) Kano. And while The Boy Who Played the Harp is a more sonically sombre affair than his previous works, the standard of observational Insight and lyrical wordplay that have so far earned him an Ivor Novello, a BRIT and the Mercury Music Prize, remains unchanged. Bending the word \"Exodus\" so that \"there's epentance in the Bible...\" lands with the punchline \"...God, remind my ex of this\" (\"175 Months\") is a shining example. It's a timely record, arriving in a moment where problems seem insurmountable. In the Bible, Dave's namesake was tasked with playing his harp to soothe a mind plagued by evil spirits-The Boy Who Played the Harp rises to the same challenge with aplomb.", "retrieval_timestamp": "2026-01-14T14:37:11.315298", "data_source": "genius_api"}

Start thinking outside of the box\nStart living outside of your phone\nWe're better off not fighting alone, it's me and the team\nStrength in numbers, scribe it in stone, Regime\n\nNearly 18 years on this earth that I've walked\nI used to search for a cause, but now I've got my head set straight\nI see it's bigger than a person in this force\nWhen there's 3000 gods and too many tongues for me to sort\nI need to touch it in its glory or to feel it in its awe\nI'm still a little rebel, I could never get the law\nThat's why I'm tryna fly to Haiti like it's twenty sets of four\nTouch the sky with my palm and watch it trickle to the floor\nNations and lords, ministers and courts\nI need 21 or more before the age of 24\nBring a penny for my thoughts, 20 for my mind\nA dozen for my brothers and 100 for my time\nYou're giving 50 or 40, I put 100 in my lines\nGive me someone to work with, I'll put 100 in it twice\nOn my life\nI'mma keep on searching till I die\n\nTake a walk with me\nLet me show you how I live\nTell you things I've seen\nBut I'd never do it justice\nSo many cities, so many things\nAnd now I'm just getting started on me\nI could travel the world staying true to myself\nNot a hero, just a somebody\n\nFrom when I was a yout, I always wanted more for myself\nI always wanted to be somewhere else\nCause growing up in the hood was always bad for your health\nThen I clocked that the music was the only real way to excel\nI had a plan, so I shelved my team\nBut it's like the mandem, they didn't see my dream\nCuh we was making mad dough just from linking the fiends\nSo they couldn't understand why I couldn't be content with the streets\nBut bun that, man, I just did me\nI expanded my horizons and started putting pain on the beats\nGetting messages from strangers telling me I saved 'em\nSaying that my songs made 'em stop living dangerous\nSuch a great feeling, it made me feel good inside\nKinda like the movie that I'm making's really saving lives\nAnd I ain't saying that I made it, please get it right\nBut it feels good to be doing something that I like\nNowadays I chill with people with a similar mind\nAnd any negativity, I'm pushing that to the side\nI'm tryna reach new heights, all they do is get high\nAnd if they don't wish you well, then just tell 'em goodbye\nAnd no diss to them, but when I see my friends\nI make 'em know that there's much more to life than the ends\n\nMy boy gone away for a spell\nNow I can't bring him with me when I travel the world\nOn the phone the other day, told me he's doing well\nI wish that I could say the same, from the top, I just fell\nTold me learn from my mistakes and embrace the gift that I was gave\nDon't wait for the game to change, be the one to make a change\nThings go dry like that, make sure you make it rain\nMan, get a hold of your ship, don't let it sail away\nGotta help yourself before you help another\nBut if you really get to do it, try to help another\nStay the same, free my brother, go and free your mother\nGet that woman out the hood, man, I mean it, brother\nJust wanna see you back where you belong\nBack up at the top\nReal friends are meant to guide you when you're lost\nKeep the people round you that will catch you when you drop\nStay up on your job\n\nEverybody sees the problem, me, I defeat the cause\nDo it for my country, feeling proud when I breathe in wars\nI can take my own thoughts and run it through a team of four\nOn top of that, I know the places that I've never been before\nThat's my dream, of course, I've seen it all, and yeah, that's too real\nTrained up, smooth as silk, always learning new skills\nReally, when I work with him, the love is the same\nAnd every time I work with someone new, there's something to gain\nSomething to do, something to learn, there's something to fix\nAnd all the new places I've been, I could run through a list\nI went to Cyprus, to Norway, Gambia and then home\nI wake up from my dream to live my dream on the next boat\nAnd yeah, I smile when I see for miles through my eyesight\nOn top of that, I'm making friends that'll last a lifetime\nLove me or hate me, what I do really makes me\nYeah, I do it for the people so I hope the people rate me\nWhat's up?", "retrieval_timestamp": "2026-01-14T14:39:21.477432", "data_source": "genius_api"}

minister\nHow'd you have a heart so sinister?\nHow are you so wasteful when people are dying in Somalia\nAfghanistan, Egypt, Libya?\nThe irony is we have no business in Syria\nBut kids are getting killed for all the business in Syria\nAnd then they try and tell you that it's ISIS, it's ISIS\nIn their attempts at killing it, how many civilians\nDied, so what's the difference between us and them?\nWhen you got drones killing kids just touching ten\nThen when a bomb goes off, every politician's lost\nLike that last strike that didn't kill a hundred men\nYou ain't the same as them\nBut all that fuel for the fire is what you gave to them\nAnd what you take from them\n\nAll my life I know my mum's been working\nIn and out of nursing, struggling, hurting\nI just find it fucked that the government is struggling\nTo care for a person that cares for a person\nSo where's the discussion on wages and budgets?\nHow they made them redundant when I was a young'un\nThe letters in our car said my mum was overdraft\nBut somehow I still had dinner money in my pocket\nAnd even the little things like ordering pizza\nWere probably the reason for overtime in the evening\nFive till ten, six hours of sleeping\nFor 22 years my mum was doing the cleaning\nDreaming that her kids would have a better life\nGo in bed at night, struggling with getting by\nThat's the reality for millions of people in a nation\nWhere a lot of us were looking for a second try\n\nA question for the new prime minister\nAnd please, tell me if I'm being narrowminded\nBut how do we spend so much money on defence\nAnd weapons to wage war when the NHS is dying?\nBursting at the seams, and what about them people\nThat voted for us to leave for the money that it would see?\n350 million we give to the EU every week\nThat our health service needs\nBut now them politicians got what they wanted\nCan you see an empty promise or a poster on the street?\nNurses in tears 'cause they're working every hour of the week\nAnd they still don't have the money that they need\nYou brought the heart of the nation to its knees\nUnderpaid, understaffed, overworked\nAnd overseen by people who can't ever understand\nHow it feels to live life like you and me\nPatients lying in the corridors\n'Cause doctors can't even find a bed for them to sleep\nI remember A&E and all them sickening screams\nOf a little girl waiting for a surgeon to be seen\nPrivatized healthcare, guns for police\nIncreased uni fees, is this what they're selling us?\nWell let me remind you just in case you've forgotten\nThat we live in Great Britain, not in Donald Trump's America\nSpeaking of America, state and the president\nWith all due respect, I've got something to say to them\nI just find it funny you can't give a hand to Palestine\nBut you can trade whole arms with Saudi Arabia\n\nLook, look\nI've got a question for the new prime minister\nAt Grenfell Tower, your response was ridiculous\nYou hid like a coward behind your 5 million\nDodged responsibility and acted like you're innocent\nAnd I can see you're terrified, you're not good at telling lies\nI'm getting why you stay away from everything that's televised\nYou look like a robot and you don't speak with any life\nIt feels to me like any guy in press could've said them lines\nImagine going to the council for the safety of your block\nAnd you've got kids but they're ignoring you at every time\nEveryone who knew about that cladding\nShould really be going prison under rule of joint enterprise\nBut if it ain't a little kid with a knife\nI bet that judge is going easy when he's giving him time\nThey don't deserve to be free\nAny builder, MP that knew about the conditions but did it to save cheese\nWhen I listen to the things that the residents had seen\nI was so shocked I couldn't even speak\nFamilies they know that had died in their sleep\nHow you choke on the smoke when you're struggling to breathe\nThe glow from the fire\nThe panic when you hear all the sirens\nThe crackling, the popping and the muffled-out screams\nThe fear in the eyes of a man that was trapped\nWho jumped 15 floors from the tower to the street\nI could only hear a fraction of the pain and the grief\nClosing my eyes, trying hard not to cry\nAnd the joy and relief in the face of a man\nWhen a woman from the flat said his neighbour was alive\nNo help from the council in keeping any list\nOr the people that survived, his neighbours and peers\nAnd for that whole meeting I could see that he was trying\nSo his smile was an island in a sea full of tears\n\nLook, I've got a message for our old prime minister\nDavid Cameron\nI mean you fucked us, resigned, then sneaked out the firing line\nI wanna know how you managed it\nAnd are you bathing in the sun while them papers have a run\nAt the woman that you left here to handle it?\nYou gonna teach your little lad to be the man that's got a plan\nAnd then the moment that it fails to abandon it?\nAre there bullies in his school?\nAnd when you pick him up after class, can you feel his embarrassment?\nI mean you never gave a fuck about the youth and that's the truth\nThere's no sympathy for you or your cabinet\nI really wish I could've seen how you were scramblin'\nWhen you lost the referendum that you had to win\nI feel like politicians are all addicts\nIn a big fat game but it's lives that you gamble with\n\nI've got a question for the leader of the Labour Party\nJeremy Corbyn, where do you wanna take the country to?\nHonestly, I wanna put my trust in you\nBut you can understand why if I've got trust issues\nDo you really have the faith of your party?\nDo you really have faith in the party that will come with you?\nAnd how do you plan on keeping all the promises?\nMan, if I'm being honest, sir, I'm struggling to get with it\nI just ain't getting it\nEverybody's great until you get them into office and then guys start forgetting things\nProve to us you're different, don't promise me anything\nGo and get justice for Rashan Charles and Edison\nAnd if you haven't had the thought to vote yet\nOr protest 'cause you don't really see the progress\nI hope you know that what they're saying is affecting us\nThe small steps are way better than no steps\n\nWe have to accept responsibility\nFor our own actions and our politics\nYes, politicians are all humans\nWe do make mistakes, we have got to learn\nHonesty, accountability, transparency\nFaith in the youth today\nIf we accomplish that, there may be hope for the human race\nThere may, there may be hope for the human
